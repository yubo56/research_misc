\begin{abstract}
    Massive stars in eccentric binaries are very important, being the progenitors
    of neutron star and high-mass X-ray binaries. In such systems, dynamical
    tides plays a crucial role. However, previous studies of dynamical tides in
    massive stellar binaries have primarily focused on the case where these
    binaries are circular. In this work, we revisit the effect of dynamical
    tides in eccentric, massive stellar binaries and derive analytical
    expressions that can be used to study binary evolution with arbitrary
    eccentricities. We apply our results to the radio pulsar J0045--7319, which
    has a massive B star companion and whose orbital period is rapidly
    decreasing. In order to reproduce this orbital decay via dynamical tides, we
    find that the core is likely rotating significantly faster than the measured
    surface rotation rate. This implies a long core-envelope coupling timescale
    in B stars.

\section{Introduction}

\textcolor{Corr}{Not yet rewritten.}

In the course of their evolution, massive stellar binaries give rise to many
astrophysical systems of interest including high mass x-ray binaries (HMXRBs)
and compact object binaries (CITATION with evolutionary pathway). In general,
the more massive star undergoes a supernova before its less massive companion,
after which the binary consists of one massive star and one compact object in an
eccentric orbit (MS-CO binary). In such a system, the evolution is dominated by
the torque from the compact object on the massive star due to dynamical tides.
While this tidal torque is now well understood for circular binaries
\citep{kushnir}, it has not been carefully studied for binaries with substantial
eccentricities. The tidal evolution of such eccentric binaries sculpt the
population of HMXRBs (CITE) as well as the population of compact object binaries
\citep{vigna2020common}.

The dissipation due to the dynamical tide in a massive star's envelope under the
influence of a \emph{circular} perturber is traditionally understood via Zahn's
parameterized theory of dynamical tides \citep{zahn1975dynamical}. However,
Zahn's theory relies on a dimensionless parameter $E_2$ reflecting the detailed
stellar structure that varies over many orders of magnitudes for typical stars.
In general, the value of $E_2$ is taken from empirical fits to simplified
stellar models \citep{hurley2002evolution, vigna2020common}. The introduction of
this uncertain parameter $E_2$ is because the dynamical tidal torque arises due
to excitation of internal gravity waves at the radiative convective boundary
(RCB) \citep{goldreich1989tidal, savonije1983tidal}, but Zahn's formula is
evaluated at the \emph{stellar} radius. Instead, it is possible re-express the
tidal torque in terms of quantities evaluated at the RCB itself, for which
dimensionless parameters are generally of order unity for a wide range of stars
\citep{kushnir}. However, \citet{kushnir} only consider circular binaries.

To study the dynamical tide in eccentric binaries, it is natural to decompose
the perturbing potential into Fourier harmonics, each of which is analogous to a
perturber on a circular orbit \citep[e.g.][]{sl, vlf}. While accurate, such
decompositions are unwieldy to evaluate as the eccentricity increases, often
requiring summing hundreds of terms and lending little intuition to the broad
scalings of the tidal torque. In this work, we show that, for the circular
torque given by \citet{kushnir}, an accurate, approximate, closed form for the
dynamical tide in a highly eccentric MS-CO binary can be obtained. Contrary to
existing models of dynamical tides \citep[e.g.][]{vigna2020common}, our
formulation improves in accuracy as the binary eccentricity increases.  We give
closed forms for both the tidal torque and inspiral rate of such an MS-CO
binary.

In Section~\ref{s:background}, we review the relevant equations. In
Sections~\ref{ss:hansens} and~\ref{s:eval}, we derive accurate, approximate
closed forms for the torque and energy transfer rate in the binary. In
Section~\ref{s:j00457319}, we apply results to the binary radio pulsar
J0045-7319. We conclude and discuss in Section~\ref{s:disc}.

\section{Tidal Torque in Massive Stars}\label{s:background}

\subsection{Circular Orbit}

We first review the case where the MS-CO binary is circular. Let $M_2$ be the
mass of the CO, $a$ be the semimajor axis of the binary, and $\Omega$ the
orbital angular frequency of the binary. The tidal torque exerted on the star by
the companion is \citep{kushnir}:
\begin{align}
    T_{\rm circ}(\omega) ={}& T_0 \sgn\p{\omega}
        \Big|\,\frac{\omega}{\Omega}\,\Big|^{8/3} \label{eq:kushnir_torque},\\
    T_0 \equiv{}& \beta_2\frac{GM_2^2r_{\rm c}^5}{a^6}
            \p{\frac{\Omega}{\sqrt{GM_{\rm c}/r_{\rm c}^3}}}^{8/3}
            \frac{\rho_{\rm c}}{\bar{\rho}_{\rm c}} \p{1 - \frac{\rho_{\rm
            c}}{\bar{\rho}_{\rm c}}}^2,\\
    \beta_2 \equiv{}&
        \s{\frac{r_{\rm c}}{g_{\rm c}}
            \p{\rd{N^2}{\ln r}}_{r = r_{\rm c}}}^{-1/3}
                \s{\frac{3}{2}\frac{3^{2/3}\Gamma^2(1/3)}{5 \cdot
                6^{4/3}} \frac{3}{4\pi}\alpha^2}.
\end{align}
Here, $\omega \equiv \Omega - 2\Omega_{\rm s}$ is the tidal forcing frequency,
$\Omega_{\rm s}$ is the spin of the massive star, $N$ is the Br\"unt-Vaisala
frequency, $r$ is the radial coordinate within the star, and $r_{\rm c}$,
$M_{\rm c}$, $g_{\rm c}$, $\rho_{\rm c}$, $\bar{\rho}_{\rm c}$ are the radius of
the RCB, the mass contained within the convective core, the gravitational
acceleration at the RCB, the stellar density at the RCB, and the average density
of the convective core, respectively. $\alpha$ and $\beta_2$ are numerical
constants defined by \citet{kushnir}, where $\beta_2 \approx 1$ is a good
approximation for a large range of stellar models. In
Eq.~\eqref{eq:kushnir_torque}, we have written the terms such that $T_0$
contains all the spin-independent terms.

\subsection{Eccentric Orbit}

The gravitational potential of an eccentric companion to quadrupolar order can
be decomposed as a sum over circular orbits \citep[e.g.][]{sl,vlf}:
\begin{align}
    U &= \sum\limits_{m=-2}^2 U_{2m} \p{\vec{r}, t},\label{eq:u_ecc}\\
    U_{2m}\p{\vec{r}, t} &= -\frac{GM_2 W_{2m} r^2}{D(t)^3}
        Y_{2m}(\theta, \phi) e^{-imf\!\!\!\:(t)},\nonumber\\
        &= -\frac{GM_2W_{2m} r^2}{a^3}Y_{2m}\p{\theta, \phi}
            \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty \!\!F_{Nm}e^{-iN\Omega t}
            \label{eq:hansen_decomp}.
\end{align}
Here, $(r, \theta, \phi)$ are the radial, polar, and azimuthal coordinates of
$\vec{r}$ respectively, $W_{2 \pm 2} = \sqrt{3\pi/10}$, $W_{2 \pm 1} = 0$,
$W_{20} = -\sqrt{\pi / 5}$, $D(t)$ is the instantaneous distance between the
star and companion, $f$ is the true anomaly, $Y_{lm}$ denote the spherical
harmonics, and $\Omega$ is the mean motion of the companion. $F_{Nm}$ denote
the \emph{Hansen coefficients} for $l = 2$ \citep[also denoted $X^n_{2m}$
in][]{murray1999solar}, which are defined implicitly in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:hansen_decomp} to be the Fourier coefficients of the perturbing
function, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{a^3}{D(t)^3} e^{-imf\!\!\!\:(t)} = \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty
        \!\!F_{Nm} e^{-iN\Omega t}.\label{eq:hansen_series}
\end{equation}
The $F_{Nm}$ can be written explicitly as an integral over the eccentric anomaly
\citep{murray1999solar, sl}:
\begin{equation}
    F_{Nm} = \frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}
        \frac{\cos\s{N\p{E - e\sin E} - mf(E)}}
            {\p{1 - e\cos E}^2}\;\mathrm{d}E.\label{eq:hansen_integral}
\end{equation}

By considering the effect of each summand in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hansen_decomp}, the
total torque on the star, energy transfer in the inertial frame, and heating in
the star's corotating frame can be obtained \citep{sl, vlf}:
\begin{align}
    T ={}& \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty F_{N2}^2
        T_{\rm circ}\p{N\Omega - 2\Omega_{\rm s}},\label{eq:tau_sum}
        \\
    \dot{E}_{\rm in} ={}&
        \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty\Bigg\{
            \p{\frac{W_{20}}{W_{22}}}^2 N\Omega F_{N0}^2 T_{\rm circ}\p{N\Omega}
                \nonumber\\
            &+ N\Omega F_{N2}^2 T_{\rm circ}\p{N\Omega - 2\Omega_{\rm s}}
            \Bigg\},\label{eq:edot_in}\\
    \dot{E}_{\rm rot} ={}& \dot{E}_{\rm in} - \Omega_{\rm s} T
        \label{eq:edot_rot}.
\end{align}
Here, dots indicate time derivatives.

From these, we can obtain the binary inspiral and circularization times using:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\dot{a}}{a} &= \frac{\dot{E}_{\rm in}}{E_{\rm orb}},
        \label{eq:dota}\\
    \frac{\dot{e}}{e} &= \p{\frac{\dot{E}_{\rm in}}{2E_{\rm orb}} +
        \frac{T}{L_{\rm orb}}} \p{\frac{1 - e^2}{e^2}}.
\end{align}
where $E_{\rm orb} = -GMM_2 / 2a$ is the orbital binding energy and $L_{\rm orb}
= \sqrt{G\p{M + M_2}a\p{1 - e^2}}$ is the orbital angular momentum. The stellar
synchronization time can also be computed assuming that the star rotates
rigidly\footnote{Note that the process of stellar synchronization is not
expected to be uniform \citep{goldreich1989tidal, su2020}, as the generated
torque depends on the core spin but deposits angular momentum in the envelope.}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\dot{\Omega}_{\rm s}}{\Omega_{\rm s}}
        = \frac{T}{kMR^2 \Omega_{\rm s}},
\end{equation}
where $kMR^2$ is the angular momentum of the star.

\section{Analytic Evaluation of Tidal Torque and Energy Transfer}\label{ss:objective}

The objective of this paper is to study the effect of dynamical tides in an
eccentric MS-CO binary. First, we compute the tidal torque by substituting the
torque due to a CO on a circular orbit [Eq.~\eqref{eq:kushnir_torque}] into the
summation Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_sum}, obtaining
\begin{equation}
    T = \sum_{N = -\infty}^{N = \infty} F_{N2}^2 T_0
        \,\mathrm{sgn}\left(N - \frac{2\Omega_{\rm s}}{ \Omega}\right) \left|N -
        \frac{2 \Omega_{\rm s}}{\Omega}\right|^{8/3}.\label{eq:tau_explicit_sum}
\end{equation}
The energy transfer rate in the inertial frame is similarly obtained by
substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:kushnir_torque} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:edot_in}
\begin{align}
    \dot{E}_{\rm in} ={}& \frac{T_0}{2}
        \sum_{N = -\infty}^{\infty} \Bigg[
            N\Omega F_{N2}^2 \mathrm{sgn}\left(N - 2\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega\right)
                    \left|N - 2 \Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega\right|^{8/3}\nonumber\\
            &+ \left(\frac{W_{20}}{W_{22}}\right)^2 \Omega
                    F_{N0}^2 |N|^{11/3}
            \Bigg].\label{eq:ein_explicit_sum}
\end{align}
These two expressions give the spin synchronization timescale of the star as
well as the inspiral time of the binary due to dynamical tides. While exact,
these expressions are difficult to evaluate for larger eccentricities, where one
often must sum hundreds or thousands of terms, each of which has a different
$F_{Nm}$. In the subsequent sections, our objective is to obtain closed-form
approximations to Eqs.~(\ref{eq:tau_explicit_sum}--\ref{eq:ein_explicit_sum}).

\subsection{Approximating Hansen Coefficients}\label{ss:hansens}

Although the Hansen coefficients can be evaluated using the integral expression
Eq.~\eqref{eq:hansen_integral}, this requires calculating a separate integral
for each $N$. It is more convenient to use the discrete Fourier Transform of the
left hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hansen_series} to calculate arbitrarily many $N$
at once \citep[as pointed out by][]{correia2014deformation}. We can then derive
scalings for the Hansen coefficients in the high-eccentricity limit. Since
$F_{(-N)m} = F_{N(-m)}$, we will only study the Hansen coefficient behavior for
$m \geq 0$.

\subsubsection{$m=2$ Hansen Coefficient Behavior at High Eccentricity}

We first consider the case where $m = 2$. Figure~\ref{fig:hansens} shows
the $F_{N2}$ for $e = 0.9$. First, we note that $F_{N2}$ is much larger when $N
\geq 0$ than for $N < 0$, so we focus on the behavior for $N \geq 0$. Here,
$F_{N2}$ has only one substantial peak. There are two characteristic frequency
scales, $\Omega$ and $\Omega_{\rm p}$ the pericenter frequency, defined by
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_{\rm p} \equiv \Omega \frac{\sqrt{1 + e}}{\p{1 - e}^{3/2}}.
        \label{eq:Wperi}
\end{equation}
For convenience, we also define $N_{\rm p}$ as the floor of $\Omega_{\rm p} /
\Omega$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    N_{\rm p} \equiv \lfloor \Omega_{\rm p} / \Omega\rfloor,
\end{equation}
Since $N_{\rm p}$ is the largest harmonic scale, we expect that the peak of the
$F_{N2}$ should occur at $\sim N_{\rm p}$. When $N \gg N_{\rm p}$, the Fourier
coefficients must fall off exponentially by the Paley-Wiener theorem since the
left hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hansen_series} is smooth. On the other hand,
when $N \ll N_{\rm p}$, since there are no characteristic frequenciees between
$\Omega$ and $\Omega_{\rm p}$, we expect that the Hansen coefficients must be
scale free between $N = 1$ and $N_{\rm p}$, i.e.\ a power law. Both of these
characteristics are reflected in Fig.~\ref{fig:hansens}.

Motivated by these considerations, we assume the Hansen coefficients can be
approximated by
\begin{equation}
    F_{N2} \approx
    \begin{cases}
        C_2 N^{p}e^{-N/\eta_2} & N \geq 0,\\
        0 & N < 0,
    \end{cases}\label{eq:fn2_fit}
\end{equation}
for some fitting coefficients $C_2$, $p$, and $\eta_2$. By performing fits to
$F_{N2}$, we found that $p \approx 2$ is relatively constant for modest-to-large
eccentricities\footnote{This can be understood, as the left hand side of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:hansen_series} resembles the second derivative of a Dirac delta
when the eccentricity is substantial: it is sharply peaked about $t = 0$, is
periodic with period $P = 2\pi / \Omega$, and has zero derivative three times
every period (at $t = \epsilon$, $t = P / 2$, and $t = P - \epsilon$ for some
small $\epsilon \sim \Omega_{\rm p}^{-1}$). This characteristics suggest that it
resembles the second derivative of a Gaussian with width $\sim \Omega_{\rm
p}^{-1}$. For timescales $\gtrsim \Omega_{\rm p}^{-1}$, this Gaussian further
resembles the Dirac delta function, which has a flat Fourier spectrum ($\propto
N^0$). Since time differentiation multiplies by $N$ in frequency space, we see
indeed that $F_{N2} \propto N^2$ for $N \lesssim N_{\rm p}$.}. For
the remainder of this work, we
take $p = 2$ to be fixed.

To constrain the remaining two free parameters $\eta_2$ and $C_2$ the
normalization, we use the well known Hansen coefficient moments
\citep{hut81}
\begin{align}
    \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty F_{N2}^2 &= \frac{f_5}{\p{1 - e^2}^{9/2}},
        \\
    f_5 &\equiv 1 + 3e^2 + \frac{3e^4}{8},\\
    \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty F_{N2}^2N
        &= \frac{2f_2}{\p{1 - e^2}^6},\\
    f_2 &\equiv 1 + \frac{15e^2}{2}
            + \frac{45 e^4}{8} + \frac{5e^6}{16}.
\end{align}
This fixes
\begin{align}
    \eta_2 &= \frac{4f_2}{5f_5\p{1 - e^2}^{3/2}},\label{eq:eta2}\\
    C_2 &= \s{\frac{4f_5}{3\p{1 - e^2}^{9/2}\eta_2^5}}^{1/2}.\label{eq:C2}
\end{align}
Despite having zero free parameters, this formula accurately describes the
$F_{N2}$ as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:hansens}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../../scripts/eccentric_tides/hansens.png}
    \caption{Plot of Hansen coefficients $F_{N2}$ for $e = 0.9$. The red circles
    denote negative $N$, while the black circles and crosses denote positive and
    negative $F_{N2}$. The blue line is the formula given by
    Eq.~\eqref{eq:fn2_fit} with $\eta_2$ and $C_2$ given by
    Eqs.~(\ref{eq:eta2}--\ref{eq:C2}). }\label{fig:hansens}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{$m = 0$ Hansen Coefficient Behavior at High Eccentricity}

We now turn to the $m = 0$ Hansen coefficients, $F_{N0}$, which are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:fn0_fit}. We know that $F_{N0} = F_{(-N)0}$, so we consider only
$N \geq 0$. From the figure, we see that the $F_{N0}$ decay exponentially. By
dimensional analysis, this decay must occur over scales $\sim N_{\rm p}$.
Therefore, we naturally assume the $F_{N0}$ scale as
\begin{equation}
    F_{N0} = C_0 e^{-\abs{N} / \eta_0}.\label{eq:fn0_fit}
\end{equation}
The two free parameters $C_0$ and $\eta_0$ are constrained by the well known
moments \citep{hut81}
\begin{align}
    \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty F_{N0}^2 &= \frac{f_5}{\p{1 - e^2}^{9/2}}
        ,\\
    \sum\limits_{N = -\infty}^\infty F_{N0}^2 N^2
        &= \frac{9e^2}{2\p{1 - e^2}^{15/2}}
            f_3,\\
    f_3 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{15e^2}{8} + \frac{15 e^4}{16}
        + \frac{5e^6}{128}.
\end{align}
We have defined the common functions $f_3$ and $f_5$. This then requires
\begin{align}
    \eta_0 &= \s{\frac{9e^2f_3}{\p{1 - e^2}^{3}f_5}}^{1/2},\label{eq:eta0}\\
    C_0 &= \s{\frac{f_5}{\p{1 - e^2}^{9/2}\eta_0}}^{1/2}.\label{eq:C0}
\end{align}
The good agreement of this analytic formula can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:fn0_fit}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{../../scripts/eccentric_tides/hansens/hansens0_90.png}
    \caption{Plot of $F_{N0}$ (black circles) for $e = 0.9$. Since $F_{N0} =
    F_{(-N)0}$, we only show positive $N$. The blue line is given by
    Eq.~\eqref{eq:fn0_fit} with $\eta_0$ and $C_0$ given by
    Eqs.~(\ref{eq:eta0}--\ref{eq:C0}).}\label{fig:fn0_fit}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Approximate Expressions for Torque and Energy Transfer}\label{s:eval}

Having found good approximations for the Hansen coefficients, we now apply them
to simplify the formulas for the torque and the energy transfer rate in
Section~\ref{ss:objective}.

\subsubsection{Tidal Torque}\label{ss:torque_eval}

Towards simplifying the torque, given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_explicit_sum}, we
replace $F_{N2}$ with Eq.~\eqref{eq:fn2_fit} and the sum with an integral,
obtaining
\begin{equation}
    T \approx T_0 \int_0^\infty C_2^2 N^4 e^{-2N / \eta_2}
        \sgn\left(N - 2\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega\right) \left|N - 2 \Omega_{\rm s} /
            \Omega\right|^{8/3}\;\mathrm{d}N.\label{eq:tau_int}
\end{equation}

To further simplify this expression, we first analyze it in the zero spin limit.
Here, Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_int} can be integrated analytically\footnote{The key to
the success of our approach is that sums of form $\sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty
F_{N2}^2 N^p$ can be approximated for non-integer $p$ in terms of $\Gamma$,
since $\int_0^\infty x^pe^{-x}\;\mathrm{d}x = \Gamma(p - 1)$. This is not
possible with existing analytical techniques.}, giving
\begin{align}
    \lim_{\Omega_{\rm s} \to 0} T &= T_0 \frac{f_5 (\eta_2/2)^{8/3}}{(1 -
        e^2)^{9/2}} \frac{\Gamma(23/3)}{4!}.\label{eq:tau_lowspin}
\end{align}
The accuracy of this formula is shown in the top panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:totals_ecc0}. For comparison, we also illustrate the torque
predicted by direct integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_explicit_sum}. It can be
see that both the integral and the analytic closed form perform well for
moderate-to-large eccentricities, but both overpredict the torque at small $e$.
This suggests that approximating the Hansen coefficient sum with an integral is
inaccurate when the eccentricity is small. This is expected, as the number of
nonnegligible Hansen coefficients is small when the eccentricity is small, so
the continuum approximation is poor.

Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_lowspin} is valid so long as $\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega \ll
\eta_2$, since the integrand is maximized when $N \sim \eta_2$. If instead
$\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega \gg \eta_2$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_explicit_sum} can be
evaluated directly with the known Hansen coefficient moments, which gives
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\Omega_{\rm s} \to \infty} T = -T_0 \sgn (\Omega_{\rm s})\;\left|2
        \Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega\right|^{8/3} \frac{f_5}{(1 -
        e^2)^{9/2}}.\label{eq:tau_highspin}
\end{equation}
The accuracy of this formula is shown in the bottom panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:totals_ecc0} for $\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega = 400$ along with the
integral expression. $400 \gg \eta_2$ for the depicted eccentricities. We see
that direct summation, the integral expression, and Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_highspin}
all agree very well for all eccentricities.

We now have the asymptotic forms of Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_int} for small and large
spins, but we can derive an approximation valid for all spins. To do this, we
first analyze the regime where the spin is small but non-negligible. In this
regime, we approximate
\begin{equation}
    N - 2\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega \simeq \frac{N}{N_{\max}}
        \left(N_{\max} - \frac{2\gamma_T
        \Omega_{\rm s}}{\Omega}\right)\label{eq:nmax_ansatz},
\end{equation}
for some free parameter $\gamma_T$. Using this, we can integrate
Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_int}, and then $\gamma_T$ is fixed by requiring our
expression reproduce the large spin limit [Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_highspin}] when
taking $\abs{\Omega_{\rm s}} \to \infty$. This procedure thus connects the two
asymptotic forms Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_highspin}--\ref{eq:tau_lowspin}), and we
obtain
\begin{align}
    T &= T_0 \frac{f_5 (\eta_2/2)^{8/3}}{(1 - e^2)^{9/2}}
        \;\mathrm{sgn}\left(1 - \gamma_T\frac{\Omega_{\rm s}}{\eta_2\Omega}\right)
            \left|
                \frac{4}{\gamma_T}
                \p{1 - \gamma_T\frac{\Omega_{\rm s}}{\eta_2\Omega}}
            \right|^{8/3} ,\label{eq:tau_approx}\\
    \gamma_T &= 4\p{\frac{4!}{\Gamma(23/3)}}^{3/8} \approx 0.691.
\end{align}
Fig.~\ref{fig:totals_s} demonstrates the accuracy of
this prediction as a function of $\Omega_{\rm s}$. As expected from the
construction of this approximation, both the large and small spin limits are
well captured, and the scaling for intermediate spins is also rather accurate.
It is worth noting that integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_int} is markedly more
accurate than the closed form when $T$ changes signs. To interpret this, we
recall that the integral uses our approximate form for the Hansen coefficients
but handles the spin dependence exactly. This suggests that our approximation in
handling the spin dependence [Eq.~\eqref{eq:nmax_ansatz}] is the dominant source
of error when $T$ is near zero. Again, this is expected, as when $e = 0.9$,
Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_explicit_sum} is the sum over many non-negligible Hansen
coefficients and thus can be well approximated by an integral. In summary, the
tidal torque must be evaluated with explicit summation
[Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_explicit_sum}] when $e$ is small, must be evaluated with
the integral expression [Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_int}] when $\Omega_{\rm s} \simeq
\Omega_{\rm p}$, and otherwise can be evaluated using the explicit formula given
by Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_approx}.

    \approx 43 \Omega$ [Eq.~\eqref{eq:Wperi}]. }\label{fig:totals_s}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pseudosynchronization}

The torque, given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_approx}, vanishes for a single
$\Omega_{\rm s}$. We call this spin the pseudosynchronization
spin frequency, given by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Omega_{\rm ps}}{\Omega} =
        \frac{\eta_2}{\gamma_T} = \frac{4f_2}{5\gamma_T f_5\p{1 -
        e^2}^{3/2}}.\label{eq:eta2_691}
\end{equation}
This has the expected scaling $\Omega_{\rm ps} \simeq \Omega_{\rm p}$. By
comparison, in standard weak friction theory of equilibrium tides, the
pseudo-synchronized rotation rate is given by
\citep{alexander73, hut81}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Omega_{\rm ps}^{\rm (Eq)}}{\Omega} = \frac{f_2}{f_5\p{1 -
        e^2}^{3/2}}.\label{eq:weaktide}
\end{equation}
This differs from our Eq.~\eqref{eq:eta2_691} by a factor of $1.15$.
Figure~\ref{fig:pseudosync} compares these two predictions, as well as
$\Omega_{\rm p}$, to applying a root finding algorithm to
Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_sum}. $\Omega_{\rm p}$ is very nearly equal to $\Omega_{\rm s,
ps}$, and both are slightly better estimates for the pseudosynchonization spin
frequency than $\Omega_{\rm ps}^{\rm (Eq)}$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../../scripts/eccentric_tides/1pseudosynchronous.png}
    \caption{Calculations of the pseudosynchronization spin frequencies

    [Eq.~\eqref{eq:Wperi}] as a function of eccentricity. The blue and red lines
    are given by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:eta2_691} and~\eqref{eq:weaktide} respectively.
    The exact solution, given in the black line, is obtained using finding a
    root finding algorithm to solve for the zero of Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_sum}.
    }\label{fig:pseudosync}
\end{figure}

Note that, very near the pseudosynchronized spin frequency,
Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_approx} predicts that $\rdil{T}{\Omega_{\rm s}} \approx 0$.
This is not physically accurate and is an artifact of our factorization ansatz
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:nmax_ansatz}.

\subsubsection{Energy Transfer}

We now turn our attention to Eq.~\eqref{eq:edot_in} and replace $F_{N2}$ and
$F_{N0}$ with their approximations [Eqs.~\eqref{eq:fn2_fit}
and~\eqref{eq:fn0_fit}] to obtain
\begin{align}
    \dot{E}_{\rm in} ={}&
        \frac{T_0 \Omega}{2} \int\limits_0^\infty \Big[
            C_2^2 N^5 e^{-2N/\eta_2} \mathrm{sgn}\left(N - 2\Omega_{\rm s} /
                \Omega\right) \left|N - 2 \Omega_{\rm s} /
                \Omega\right|^{8/3}\nonumber\\
            &+ 2 \p{\frac{W_{20}}{W_{22}}}^2 C_0^2 e^{-2N / \eta_0} N^{11/3}
        \Big]\;\mathrm{d}N.\label{eq:ein_int}
\end{align}
We evaluate the $m = 2$ and $m = 0$ contributions to this expression separately.

We first examine the $m = 2$ contribution using the same procedure that was used
in Section~\ref{ss:torque_eval} for the torque. If the spin is large,
$\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega \gg \eta_2$, the $m = 2$ contribution evaluates to
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\Omega_{\rm s} \to \infty} \dot{E}_{\rm in}^{(m=2)} =
        -\frac{T_0\Omega}{2} \; \mathrm{sgn}(\Omega_{\rm s})|2\Omega_{\rm
        s}/\Omega|^{8/3} \frac{2f_2}{(1 - e^2)^6}.\label{eq:ein_highs}
\end{equation}
If the spin is instead moderate, $\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega \lesssim \eta / 2$, we
make the approximation
\begin{equation}
    N - 2\Omega_{\rm s} / \Omega \simeq \frac{N}{N_{\max}}
        \left(N_{\max} - \frac{2\gamma_E
        \Omega_{\rm s}}{\Omega}\right)\label{eq:nmax_ansatz},
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_E$ is a free parameter. This lets us integrate the $m = 2$
component of Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_int} analytically, and we can constrain
$\gamma_E$ by requiring the integral agree with Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_highs}. This
yields
\begin{align}
    \dot{E}_{\rm in}^{(m=2)}
        ={}& \frac{T_0\Omega f_5 (\eta_2/2)^{11/3}}{2(1-e^2)^{9/2}}
            \nonumber\\
        &\times \mathrm{sgn}\p{1 - \gamma_E\frac{\Omega_s}{\eta_2 \Omega}}
            \left|
                \frac{4}{\gamma_E}
                \p{1 - \gamma_E\frac{\Omega_s}{\eta_2 \Omega}}
            \right|^{8/3},\\
    \gamma_E ={}& 4\p{\frac{5!}{\Gamma\p{26/3}}}^{3/8}
        \approx 0.5886.
\end{align}

The $m = 0$ contribution to Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_int} is much more straightforward
and can be directly integrated using the parameterization
Eq.~\eqref{eq:fn0_fit}. So we obtain the total energy transfer rate
\begin{align}
    \dot{E}_{\rm in} ={}& \frac{T_0 \Omega}{2}\Bigg[\frac{f_5
        (\eta_2/2)^{11/3}}{(1-e^2)^{9/2}} \frac{\Gamma(26/3)}{4!}\nonumber\\
        &\times \mathrm{sgn}\p{1 - \gamma_E\frac{\Omega_s}{\eta_2 \Omega}}
            \left|1 - \gamma_E\frac{\Omega_s}{\eta_2 \Omega}\right|^{8/3}
            \nonumber\\
        &+
    \frac{f_5 \Gamma(14 / 3)}{(1 - e^2)^{10}} \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{8/3}
            \left(\frac{e^2 f_3}{f_5}\right)^{11/6}\Bigg].
            \label{eq:ein_dot_tot}
\end{align}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:e0}, we show the agreement of Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_dot_tot} in the
small and large spin limits, where good agreement is observed both with the
integral form Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_int} and the closed form
Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_dot_tot}. Again, when the spin and eccentricity are both
negligible, both the integral and closed form expressions overpredict the energy
dissipation rate. In Fig.~\ref{fig:e_spin}, we show the energy
transfer rate using both the integral and analytic closed forms as a function of
spin when $e = 0.9$. The performance of the analytic expression degrades near
pseudosynchronization but generally captures the correct scaling, while the
integral expression remains accurate for all spins.

\section{Example System: PSR J0045+7319}\label{s:j00457319}

As an example of our calculations above, we consider PSR J0045-7319 binary
system \citep{bell1995psr}. The system was initially reported to have pulsar
mass $M_2 = 1.4M_{\odot}$, $q = 6.3$, $e = 0.808$, orbital period $P =
51.17\;\mathrm{days}$, and $\dot{P} = -3.03\times 10^{-7}$
\citep{kaspi1996params}. This gives a mass of $M = 8.8M_{\odot}$ for the massive
star and an orbital separation $a = 126R_{\odot}$. Furthermore, the measured
luminosity $L = 1.2 \times 10^4L_{\odot}$ and surface temperature $T_{\rm surf}
= (24000 \pm 1000)\;\mathrm{K}$ give the radius of the star to be $R =
6.4R_{\odot}$ \citep{kaspi1996params}. The internal structure of the star can be
obtained by comparison to detailed stellar structure calculations, yielding
$M_{\rm c} \approx 3M_{\odot}$ and $r_{\rm c} \approx 1.38R_{\odot}$
\citep{kumar1998}. To account for uncertainties in the stellar structure, we
take this $M_{\rm c}$ to be fixed and consider a range of $r_{\rm c} \in [0.7,
1.5]$. To compute the tidal torque, we must also make assumptions about the
ratio $\rho_{\rm c} / \bar{\rho}_{\rm c}$, which can only be obtained via
stellar structure simulations. We take $\rho_{\rm c} / \bar{\rho}_{\rm c}
\approx 1/3$ as a fiducial value (though in reality this likely varies with
$r_{\rm c}$).

Figure~\ref{fig:j0045_fid} shows $\dot{P}$ as a function of $\Omega_{\rm s}$,
using Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_dot_tot}, evaluated using four different $r_{\rm c}$.
The measured $\dot{P}$ is shown by the horizontal dashed line. Note that for the
most compact core radius $r _{\rm c} = 0.7R_{\odot}$, there are no solutions for
$\Omega_{\rm s}$; even a maximally spinning core cannot generate enough tidal
dissipation to match the observed $\dot{P}$. Substantial retrograde rotation is
required to match the predictions, a few times faster than the critical rotation
rate of the entire star. As such, strong differential rotation is required
between the core and envelope of the star.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../../scripts/eccentric_tides/1_7319_disps.png}
    \caption{$\dot{P}$ as a function of $\Omega_{\rm s}$ for the canonical
    parameters for J0045-7319, as evaluated by explicit summation of
    Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_explicit_sum}, for four different values of $r_{\rm c}$
    (legend, in units of $R_{\odot}$). The measured $\dot{P} = -3.03\times
    10^{-7}$ is shown by the horizontal dashed line. The vertical shaded region
    is the region where $\Omega_{\rm s}$ is less than the breakup rotation rate
    of the star as a whole, given by $\sqrt{GM / R^3}$. Each $r_{\rm c}$ is only
    shown for $\abs{\Omega_{\rm s}} \leq \Omega_{\rm s, c} \equiv \sqrt{GM_{\rm
    c} / r_{\rm c}^3}$ the \emph{core} breakup rotation rate.
    }\label{fig:j0045_fid}
\end{figure}

% \subsection{Constraints on Stellar Structure}

% As discovered above, requiring that the observed $\dot{P}$ lie within the
% range attainable via tidal dissipation imposes constraints on $r_{\rm c}$. We
% can compute the range of attainable $\dot{P}$ by setting the spin frequency
% equal to the breakup frequency in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_int}, giving
% \begin{equation}
%     \dot{P} \lesssim
%         -\frac{6\pi}{q}\beta_2 \left(\frac{r_{\rm c}}{a}\right)^5
%         \frac{\rho_{\rm c}}{\bar{\rho}_{\rm c}} \left(1 -
%         \frac{\rho_{\rm c}}{\bar{\rho}_{\rm c}}\right)^2 2^{8/3}\frac{f_2}{(1 -
%         e^2)^6}.\label{eq:dotp_rc}
% \end{equation}
% For J0045+7319, requiring that $\dot{P}$ equal its observed value gives $r_{\rm
% c} \gtrsim 0.93R_{\odot}$ when using $\rho_{\rm c} / \bar{\rho}_{\rm c} = 1/3$.
% Indeed, in Fig.~\ref{fig:j0045_fid}, there is a solution equal to the observed
% $\dot{P}$ when $r_{\rm c} \geq R_{\odot}$ but not when $r_{\rm c} =
% 0.7R_{\odot}$. The strong dependence of the right hand side on
% Eq.~\eqref{eq:dotp_rc} on $r_{\rm c}$ suggests that this constraint is somewhat
% insensitive to other system uncertanties.

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{s:disc}

\textcolor{Corr}{This section is not complete.}

The primary results of the paper are approximate expressions for the torque,
Eq.~\eqref{eq:tau_approx}, and the energy dissipation rate,
Eq.~\eqref{eq:ein_dot_tot}, in closed form.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Thanks to some references (Barker \& Ogilvie, my work), there seems to
        be some evidence that hydrodynamic wave breaking could cause all IGW to
        break and not reflect, once the pericenter wave reaches nonlinear
        amplitudes.

    \item As noted in the text, the approximate forms enforce
        $\rdil{T}{\Omega_{\rm s}} = 0$, which the actual torque does not satisfy.
        This introduces some slight errors in the exact value of the torque very
        near pseudosynchronization.

    \item It is pointed out that the $v \sin i$ for J0045-7319 is $110 \pm 10
        \;\mathrm{km/s}$, while the breakup frequency is $\sqrt{GM / R} =
        512\;\mathrm{km/s}$. Thus, it is expected that the stellar surface is
        rotating at an appreciable fraction of breakup.

    \item Obliquity of the star? Dissipation rate should be somewhere between
        prograde and retrograde.

    \item Maybe core is much bigger due to similar process as chemically
        homogeneous stars?
\end{itemize}
