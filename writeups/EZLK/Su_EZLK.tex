\begin{abstract}
    Many proposed scenarios for black hole mergers consist of a tertiary
    companion that induces von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai eccentricity cycles in the
    inner binary. An attractive feature of such mechanisms is the enhanced
    merger rate when the octupole-order corrections, also known as the eccentric
    Kozai mechanism, are important. This can be the case when the tertiary is of
    comparable mass to the binary components. However, in this work, we show
    that this enhancement is preferentially more efficient for binaries with
    smaller mass ratios, sometimes by as much as a factor of $20$. We use a
    combination of numerical and analytic approaches to fully characterize these
    octupole-induced binary black hole mergers and provide analytic criteria for
    quickly estimating the strength of this enhancement. We show that the
    resulting observational signature is in tension with the mass ratio
    distribution obtained by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration.

\section{Introduction}\label{s:intro}

The $50$ or so black hole (BH) binary mergers detected by the LIGO/VIRGO
collaboration to date \citep{LIGOO3a} continue to motivate theoretical studies of their
formation channels. These range from the traditional isolated binary evolution,
in which mass transfer and friction in the common envelope phase cause the
binary orbit to decay sufficiently that it subsequently merges via emission of
gravitational waves (GWs) \citep[e.g.,][]{lipunov1997black,
lipunov2017first, podsiadlowski2003formation, belczynski2010effect,
belczynski2016first, dominik2012double, dominik2013double, dominik2015double},
to various flavors of dynamical formation channels that involve either strong
gravitational scatterings in dense clusters \citep[e.g.,][]{zwart1999black,
o2006binary, miller2009mergers, banerjee2010stellar, downing2010compact,
ziosi2014dynamics, rodriguez2015binary, samsing2017assembly, samsing2018black,
rodriguez2018post, gondan2018eccentric} or mergers in isolated triple and
quadruple systems induced by distant companions \citep[e.g.,][]{miller2002four,
wen2003eccentricity, antonini2012secular, antonini2017binary, silsbee2017lidov,
LL17, LL18, randall2018induced, hoang2018black, fragione2019, fragione2019loeb,
LL19, bin_misc5, bin_misc1, bin_misc2}.

\textcolor{red}{Given the large number of merger events to be detected in the
coming years, it is important to search for observational signatures to
distinguish various BH binary formation channels. One possible indicator is
merger eccentricity: previous studies find that dynamical binary-single
interactions in dense clustures \citep[e.g.,][]{samsing2017assembly,
rodriguez2018post, samsing2018black, fragione2019bromberg} or in galactic
triples \citep{silsbee2017lidov, antonini2017binary, fragione2019loeb} may lead
to BH binaries that enter the LIGO band with modest eccentricities. Another
possible indicator is the spin-orbit misalignment of the binary. In particular,
the mass-weighted projection of the BH spins, $\chi_{\rm eff} = \p{m_1
\bm{\chi}_1 + m_2\bm{\chi}_2} / (m_1 + m_2) \cdot \uv{L}$, can be measured
through the binary inspiral waveform [here, $m_{1,2}$ is the BH mass,
$\bm{\chi}_{1,2} = c\bm{S}_{1,2} / \p{Gm_{1,2}^2}$ is the dimensionless BH spin,
and $\uv{L}$ is the unit orbital angular momentum vector of the binary].
Different formation histories yield different distributions of $\chi_{\rm eff}$
\citep{LL17, LL18, antonini2018precessional, rodriguez2018post, gerosa2018,
LL19, su2020spin}.}

A third possible indicator is the distribution of masses and mass ratio of
merging BHs. In Fig.~\ref{fig:qhist}, we show the distribution of the mass
ratio $q \equiv m_2 / m_1$, where $m_1 \geq m_2$, for all LIGO/VIRGO binaries
detected as of the O3a data release \citep{LIGOO3a}. The distribution distinctly
peaks around $q \sim 0.7$. BH binaries formed via isolated binary evolution are
generally expected to have $q \gtrsim 0.5$ \citep{belczynski2016first,
olejak2020}. On the other hand, dynamical formation channels may produce a
larger variety of distributions for the binary mass ratio
\citep[e.g.,][]{rodriguez2016binary, silsbee2017lidov, fragione2019}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{3qhist.png}
    \caption{Histogram of the mass ratios $q \equiv m_2 / m_1$ of binary BH
    mergers in the O3a data release, excluding the two NS-NS mergers but including
    GW190814, whose $2.5M_{\odot}$ secondary may be a BH \citep{LIGOO3a}.
    }\label{fig:qhist}
\end{figure}

In this paper, we study in detail the mass ratio distribution for BH mergers
induced by tertiary companions in triple systems. In this scenario, a tertiary
BH on a sufficiently inclined (outer) orbit induces phases of extreme
eccentricity in the inner binary via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai
(ZLK;\@\citealp{zeipel, lidov, kozai}) effect, leading to efficient gravitational
radiation and orbital decay.  While the original ZLK effect relies on the
leading-order, quadrupolar gravitational perturbation from the tertiary on the
inner binary, the octupole order terms can become important when the triple
system is mildly hierachical, the outer orbit is eccentric ($e_{\rm out} \neq 0$)
and the inner binary BHs have unequal masses \citep[e.g.,][]{ford2000secular,
blaes2002kozai, lithwick2011eccentric, LML15}. The strength of the
octupole effect depends on the dimensionless parameter
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\rm oct} = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \frac{a}{a_{\rm out}}
        \frac{e_{\rm out}}{1 - e_{\rm out}^2}.\label{eq:eps_oct}
\end{equation}
where $a, a_{\rm out}$ are the semi-major axes of the inner and outer binaries,
respectively. Previous studies have shown that the octupole terms generally
increase the inclination window for extreme eccentricity excitation, and thus
enhance the rate of successful binary mergers \citep{LL18}. As $\epsilon_{\rm
oct} \propto (1-q)/(1+q)$ increases with decreasing $q$, we expect that
ZLK-induced BH mergers favor binaries with smaller mass ratios. The main goal of
this paper is to quantify the dependence of the merger fraction/probability on
$q$, using a combination of analytic and numerical calculations.

We review some analytic results of ZLK oscillations in
Section~\ref{s:background}, study tertiary-induced BH mergers in
Section~\ref{s:with_gw}, calculate the merger fractions as a function of mass
ratio in Section~\ref{s:merger_frac}, \textcolor{red}{discuss the resulting BH
merger mass ratio distribution observed by GW detectors in
Section~\ref{s:q_dist},} and conclude and discuss in Section~\ref{s:conclusion}.

\section{Von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) Oscillations: Analytical
Results}\label{s:background}

Consider two BHs orbiting each other with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ on a orbit with
semi-major axis $a$, eccentricity $e$, and angular momentum $\bm{L}$. An external,
tertiary BH of mass $m_3$ orbits this inner binary with semi-major axis $a_{\rm
out}$, eccentricity $e_{\rm out}$, and angular momentum $\bm{L}_{\rm out}$. The
reduced masses of the inner and outer binaries are $\mu \equiv m_1m_2 / m_{12}$
and $\mu_{\rm out} \equiv m_{12} m_3 / m_{123}$ respectively, where $m_{12} =
m_1 + m_2$ and $m_{123} = m_{12} + m_3$. These two binary orbits are further
described by three angles: the inclinations $i$ and $i_{\rm out}$, the arguments
of pericenters $\omega$ and $\omega_{\rm out}$, and the longitudes of the
ascending nodes $\Omega$ and $\Omega_{\rm out}$. These angles are defined in a
coordinate system where the $z$ axis is aligned with the total angular momentum
$\bm{J} = \bm{L} + \bm{L}_{\rm out}$ (i.e.\ the invariant plane is perpendicular
to $\bm{J}$). The mutual inclination between the two orbits is denoted $I \equiv
i + i_{\rm out}$. Note that $\Omega_{\rm out} = \Omega + 180^\circ$.

To study the evolution of the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary
BH, we use the double-averaged secular equations of motion, including the
interactions between the inner binary and the tertiary up to the octupole level
of approximation as given by \citet{LML15}. For the remainder of this section,
we include general relativistic apsidal precession of the inner binary, a first
order post-Newtonian (1PN) effect, but omit the emission of GWs, a 2.5PN
effect---this will be considered in Section~\ref{s:with_gw}. We group the
results by increasing order of approximation, starting by ignoring the
octupole-order effects entirely.

\subsection{Quadrupole Order}

At the quadrupole order, the tertiary induces eccentricity oscillations in the
inner binary on the characteristic timescale
\begin{equation}
    t_{\rm ZLK} = \frac{1}{n}\frac{m_{12}}{m_3}
            \p{\frac{a_{\rm out, eff}}{a}}^3,\label{eq:def_tzlk}
\end{equation}
where $n \equiv \sqrt{Gm_{12} / a^3}$ is the mean motion of the inner binary,
and $a_{\rm out, eff} \equiv a_{\rm out}\sqrt{1 - e_{\rm out}^2}$. During these
oscillations, there are two conserved quantities, the total energy and the total
orbital angular momentum. Through some manipulation, the total angular momentum
can be written in terms of the conserved quantity $K$ given by
\begin{equation}
    K \equiv j(e) \cos I - \eta e^2 / 2. \label{eq:def_K}
\end{equation}
Here, $j(e) \equiv \sqrt{1 - e^2}$ and $\eta$ is the ratio of the magnitudes of
the angular momenta at zero inner binary eccentricity:
\begin{equation}
    \eta \equiv \p{\frac{L}{L_{\rm out}}}_{e = 0}
        = \frac{\mu}{\mu_{\rm out}}\s{\frac{m_{12}a}
            {m_{123}a_{\rm out}(1 - e_{\rm out}^2)}}^{1/2}.\label{eq:def_eta}
\end{equation}
Note that when $\eta = 0$, $K$ reduces to the classical ``Kozai constant'', $K =
j(e) \cos I$.

The maximum eccentricity $e_{\max}$ attained in these ZLK oscillations can be
computed analytically at the quadrupolar order. It depends on the
``competition'' between the 1PN apsidal precession rate $\dot{\omega}_{\rm GR}$
and the ZLK rate $t_{\rm ZLK}^{-1}$. The relevant dimensionless parameter is
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\rm GR} \equiv \p{\dot{\omega}_{\rm GR} t_{\rm ZLK}}_{e = 0}
        = \frac{3Gm_{12}}{c^2} \frac{m_{12}}{m_3}\frac{a_{\rm out, eff}^3}{a^4}.
\end{equation}
It can then be shown that, for an initially circular inner binary, $e_{\max}$ is
related to the initial mutual inclination $I_{\rm 0}$ by \citep{LML15,
anderson2016formation}:
\begin{align}
    \frac{3}{8}\frac{j^2(e_{\max}) - 1}{j^2(e_{\max})}\Big[&
        5\p{\cos I_0 + \frac{\eta}{2}}^2
        - \p{3 + 4\eta \cos I_0 + \frac{9}{4}\eta^2}j^2(e_{\max})
            \nonumber\\
        &+ \eta^2 j^4(e_{\max})
    \Big] + \epsilon_{\rm GR}\s{1 - \frac{1}{j(e_{\max})}} = 0.
    \label{eq:emax_quad}
\end{align}
In the limit $\eta \to 0$ and $\epsilon_{\rm GR} \to 0$, we recover the
well-known result $e_{\max} = \sqrt{1 - (5/3) \cos^2 I_0}$. For general $\eta$,
$e_{\max}$ attains its limiting value $e_{\lim}$ when $I_{\rm 0} = I_{\rm 0,
\lim}$, where
\begin{equation}
    \cos I_{\rm 0, \lim} = \frac{\eta}{2}\s{\frac{4}{5}j^2(e_{\lim}) -
        1}.\label{eq:def_I0lim}
\end{equation}
Note that $I_{\rm 0, \lim} \geq 90^\circ$ with equality only when $\eta
= 0$. Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_I0lim} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:emax_quad}, we find
that $e_{\lim}$ satisfies
\begin{align}
    \frac{3}{8}\s{j^2(e_{\lim}) - 1}&\s{-3 + \frac{\eta^2}{4}
        \p{\frac{4}{5}j^2(e_{\lim}) - 1}}\nonumber\\
        &+ \epsilon_{\rm GR}\s{1 - \frac{1}{j(e_{\lim})}} = 0.
        \label{eq:def_elim}
\end{align}
On the other hand, eccentricity excitation ($e_{\max} \geq 0$) is only possible
when $(\cos I_{\rm 0})_- \leq \cos I_{\rm 0} \leq (\cos I_{\rm 0})_+$ where
\begin{equation}
    \p{\cos I_{\rm 0}}_{\pm} = \frac{1}{10}\p{-\eta \pm \sqrt{\eta^2 + 60 -
        \frac{80}{3}\epsilon_{\rm GR}}}.\label{eq:I0bounds}
\end{equation}
For $I_{\rm 0}$ outside of this range, no eccentricity excitation is possible.
This condition reduces to the well-known $\cos^2 I_{\rm 0} \leq 3/5$ when $\eta
= \epsilon_{\rm GR} = 0$.

\subsection{Octupole Order: Test-particle Limit}\label{ss:oct_tp}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{composite_tp.png}
    \caption{The maximum eccentricity achieved for an inner binary in the
    test-particle limit as a function of the initial inclination angle $I_0$.
    The triple system parameters are: $a = 100\;\mathrm{AU}$, $a_{\rm out, eff}
    = 3600\;\mathrm{AU}$, $m_{12} = 50M_{\odot}$, $m_3 = 30M_{\odot}$, and
    $e_{\rm out} = 0.6$; the corresponding octupole strength parameter is
    $\epsilon_{\rm oct} = 0.02$ and $\eta \simeq 0$. The octupole-level secular
    equations of motion are integrated for $2000t_{\rm ZLK}$ (see
    Eq.~\ref{eq:def_tzlk}), and the maximum eccentricity attained during this
    time is recorded and shown as a blue dot for each initial condition. We
    consider $1000$ initial inclinations in the range $50^\circ \leq I_0 \leq
    130^\circ$, and each $I_0$ is simulated five times, with the initial orbital
    elements $\omega$, $\omega_{\rm out}$, and $\Omega = \Omega_{\rm out} - \pi$
    chosen randomly $\in [0, 2\pi)$ % chktex 9
    for each simulation. The dotted black line shows the quadrupole-level result
    (Eq.~\ref{eq:emax_quad} with $\eta = 0$), and $e_{\lim}$
    (Eq.~\ref{eq:def_elim}) is shown as the horizontal red line. The vertical
    purple lines denote the boundary of the octupole-active inclination window,
    based on the fitting formula from \citet{MLL16} (Eq.~\ref{eq:I_oct_MLL}).
    }\label{fig:composite_tp}
\end{figure}

The relative strength of the octupole-order potential to the quadrupole-order
potential is determined by the dimensionless parameter $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$
(Eq.~\ref{eq:eps_oct}). When $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ is non-negligible, $K$ is no
longer conserved, and the system evolution becomes chaotic
\citep{ford2000secular, katz2011long, lithwick2011eccentric, li2014chaos,
LML15}. As a result, analytic (and semi-analytic) results have only been given
for the test-particle limit, where $m_2 = \eta = 0$. We briefly review these
results below.

Due to the non-conservation of $K$, $e_{\max}$ evolves irregularly ZLK cycles,
and the orbit may even flip between prograde ($I < 90^\circ$) and retrograde ($I
> 90^\circ$) if $K$ changes sign (in the test-particle limit, $K = j(e) \cos
I$). During these orbit flips, the eccentricity maxima reach their largest
values but do not exceed $e_{\lim}$ \citep{lithwick2011eccentric, LML15,
anderson2016formation}. These orbit flips occur on characteristic timescale
$t_{\rm ZLK, oct}$, given by \citep{antognini2015timescales}
\begin{equation}
    t_{\rm ZLK, oct} = t_{\rm ZLK}\frac{128\sqrt{10}}{
        15\pi\sqrt{\epsilon_{\rm oct}}}.\label{eq:def_tzlkoct}
\end{equation}
The octupole potential tends to widen the inclination range for which the
eccentricity can reach $e_{\lim}$; we refer to this widened range as the
\emph{octupole-active window}. \textcolor{red}{Figure~\ref{fig:composite_tp}
shows the maximum eccentricity attained by an inner binary orbited by a tertiary
companion with inclination $I_0$. The octupole-active window is visible as a
range of inclinations centered on $I_0 = 90^\circ$ that attain $e_{\lim}$ (the
red horizontal dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp}).}
\citet{katz2011long} show that this window can be approximated using analytic
arguments when $\epsilon_{\rm oct} \ll 1$. \citet{MLL16} give a more general
numerical fitting formula describing the octupole-active window for arbitrary
$\epsilon_{\rm oct}$. They find that orbit flips and extreme eccentricity
excitation occur for $I_{\rm flip, -} \lesssim I_0 \lesssim I_{\rm flip, +}$
where
\begin{equation}
    \cos^2 I_{\rm flip, \pm} = \begin{cases}
        0.26\p{\frac{\epsilon_{\rm oct}}{0.1}}
            - 0.536\p{\frac{\epsilon_{\rm oct}}{0.1}}^2\\
            \quad + 12.05\p{\frac{\epsilon_{\rm oct}}{0.1}}^3
            - 16.78\p{\frac{\epsilon_{\rm oct}}{0.1}}^4
            & \epsilon_{\rm oct} \lesssim 0.05,\\
        0.45 & \epsilon_{\rm oct} \gtrsim 0.05.
    \end{cases} \label{eq:I_oct_MLL}
\end{equation}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp}, we see that with the octupole effect included,
$e_{\max}$ indeed attains $e_{\lim}$ when $I_0$ is within the broad
octupole-active window given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:I_oct_MLL}
\textcolor{red}{(denoted by the vertical purple lines in
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp})}.

\subsection{Octupole Order: General Masses}\label{ss:oct_gen}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{1nogw_vec_q02_short.png}
    \caption{An example of the triple evolution for a system with significant
    octupole effects and finite $\eta$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:def_eta}). We use the
    same system parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp} except for $q =
    0.2$, corresponding to $\eta \approx 0.087$ and $\epsilon_{\rm oct} \approx
    0.007$, and $I_0 = 93.5^\circ$. The three panels show the inner orbit
    eccentricity, the mutual inclination, and the generalized ``Kozai constant''
    $K$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:def_K}). In the first panel, $e_{\lim}$ is denoted by the
    black dashed line. By comparing the second and third panels, we see that
    orbit flips occur when $K$ crosses the dotted line, given by $K = K_{\rm c}
    \equiv -\eta / 2$. }\label{fig:nogw_fiducial}
\end{figure}

For general inner binary masses, when the angular momentum ratio $\eta$ is
non-negligible, the octupole-level ZLK behavior is less well-studied
\citep[see][]{LML15}. Figure~\ref{fig:nogw_fiducial} shows an example of the
evolution of a triple system with significant $\eta$ and $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$.
Many aspects of the evolution discussed in Section~\ref{ss:oct_tp} are still
observed: the ZLK eccentricity maxima and $K$ evolve over timescales $\gg t_{\rm
ZLK}$; the eccentricity never exceeds $e_{\lim}$; when $K$ crosses $K_{\rm c}
\equiv -\eta / 2$, an orbit flip occurs (this follows by inspection of
Eq.~\ref{eq:def_K}).

However, Eq.~\eqref{eq:I_oct_MLL} no longer describes the octupole-active window
as $\eta$ is non-negligible \citep[see also][]{rodet_inprep}. In the top panel
of Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}, the blue dots show the maximum achieved
eccentricity of a system with the same parameters as Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp}
except with $q = 0.5$ (so $\epsilon_{\rm oct} = 0.007$ and $\eta = 0.087$).
Here, it can be seen that no prograde systems can attain $e_{\lim}$, and only a
small range of retrograde inclinations $\geq I_{\rm 0, \lim}$ (see
Eq.~\ref{eq:def_I0lim}) are able to reach $e_{\lim}$. In fact, there is even a
clear double valued feature around $I \approx 75^\circ$ in the top panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_dist} that is not present in
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp}. If $q$ is decreased to $0.3$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p3}) or further to $0.2$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p2}), $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ increases while $\eta$
decreases. This permits a larger number of prograde systems to reach $e_{\lim}$,
though a small range of inclinations near $I_0 = 90^\circ$ still do not reach
$e_{\lim}$; we call this range of inclinations the ``octupole-inactive gap''. On
the other hand, if $q$ is held at $0.5$ as in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_dist} and
$e_{\rm out}$ is increased to $0.9$ while holding $a_{\rm out, eff} =
3600\;\mathrm{AU}$ constant, both $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ and $\eta$ increase; the
top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_e91p5} shows that prograde systems still
fail to reach $e_{\lim}$ for these parameters, despite the increase in
$\epsilon_{\rm oct}$. The top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_bindist}
illustrates the behavior when the inner binary is substantially more compact ($a
= 10\;\mathrm{AU}$): even though $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ is larger than it is
in any of Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_e91p5}, we
see that prograde perturbers fail to attain $e_{\lim}$. All of these examples
(top panels of Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist})
illustrate importance of $\eta$ in determining the range of inclinations for the
system to be able to reach $e_{\lim}$.

\textcolor{red}{In general, we find that a symmetric octupole-active window (as
in Eq.~\ref{eq:I_oct_MLL}) can be realized for sufficiently small $\eta$. In
\citet{rodet_inprep}, they find that $\eta \lesssim 0.1$ is sufficient for a
symmetric octupole-active window, but in this work, $\eta \lesssim 0.01$ is
necessary ($\eta \approx 0.004$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_tp} while $\eta
\approx 0.05$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p2}). Thus, the critical $\eta$ above
which the symmetry of the octupole-active window is significantly broken likely
depends on $e_{\lim}$ (in \citet{rodet_inprep}, $e_{\lim} \sim 10^{-3}$). When
$\eta$ is non-negligible, there are up to two octupole-active windows: a

\section{Tertiary-Induced Black Hole Mergers}\label{s:with_gw}

Emission of gravitational waves (GWs) affects the evolution of the inner
binary, which can be incorporated into the secular equations of motion for the
triple \citep[e.g.,]{peters1964, LL18}. The associated orbital and eccentricity
decay rates are \citep{peters1964}:
\begin{align}
    \at{\frac{1}{a}\rd{a}{t}}_{\rm GW} &\equiv -\frac{1}{t_{\rm GW}}\nonumber\\
        &= -\frac{64}{5}\frac{G^3 \mu m_{12}^2}{c^5a^4j^7(e)}
            \p{1 + \frac{73}{24}e^2 + \frac{37}{96}e^4}\label{eq:def_tgw},\\
    \at{\rd{e}{t}}_{\rm GW} &= -\frac{304}{15}\frac{G^3 \mu m_{12}^2}{c^5a^4}
        \frac{1}{j^{5}(e)}\p{1 + \frac{121}{304}e^2}\label{eq:dedt_gw}.
\end{align}
GW emission can cause the orbit to decay significantly when extreme
eccentricities are reached during the ZLK cycles described in the previous
section. This allows even wide binaries ($\sim 100\;\mathrm{AU}$) to merge
efficiently within a Hubble time. While various numerical examples of such
tertiary-induced mergers have been given before (e.g.\ \citet{LL18}; see also
\citet{LL19} for ``population synthesis''), in this section we examine the
dynamical process in detail in order to develop an analytic understanding.
Our fiducial system parameters are as in Fig.~\ref{fig:nogw_fiducial}:
$a_{\rm out, eff} = 4500\;\mathrm{AU}$, $e_{\rm out} =
0.6$, $m_{12} = 50M_{\odot}$ (with varying $q$), $m_3 = 30M_{\odot}$, and the
inner binary has initial $a_0 = 100\;\mathrm{AU}$ and $e_0 = 10^{-3}$.

\subsection{Merger Windows and Probability: Numerical Results}\label{ss:windows}

To understand what initial conditions lead to successful mergers within a Hubble
time, we integrate the double-averaged octupole-order ZLK equations including GW
radiation. We terminate each integration if either $a = 0.005a_0$ (a successful
merger) or the system age reaches $10\;\mathrm{Gyr}$. The middle panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_dist} shows the merger time $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of
$I_0$ for our fiducial parameters with $q = 0.5$. We note that only retrograde
inclinations lead to successful mergers, and almost all successful mergers are
rapid, with $T_{\rm m} \lesssim t_{\rm ZLK, oct}$. These are the result of a
system merging by emitting a single large burst of GW radiation during an
extreme-eccentricity ZLK cycle, which we term a ``one-shot merger''. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p3}, $q$ is decreased to $0.3$, and some prograde
systems are also able to merge successfully. However, these prograde systems
exhibit a broad range of merger times, with $T_{\rm m} \gtrsim t_{\rm ZLK,
oct}$. These occur when a system gradually emits a small amount of GW radiation
at every eccentricity maximum---we term this a ``smooth merger''. Additionally,
the octupole-inactive gap near $I_0 = 90^\circ$ is visible in the merger time
plot (middle panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p3}). The middle panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_1p2}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist} show the behavior of
$T_{\rm m}$ for the other parameter regimes and also exhibit these two
categories of mergers and the octupole-inactive gap.

Due to the chaotic nature of the octupole-order ZLK effect, the initial
inclination $I_0$ alone is not sufficient to determine with certainty whether a
system can merge within a Hubble time. Instead, for a given $I_0$, we can use
numerical integrations with various $\omega$, $\omega_{\rm out}$, and $\Omega$
to compute a merger probability, denoted by
\begin{equation}
    P_{\rm merger}\p{I_0; q, e_{\rm out}} = P\p{T_{\rm m} < 10\;\mathrm{Gyr}},
        \label{eq:def_pmerge}
\end{equation}
where the notation $P_{\rm merger}\p{I_0; q, e_{\rm out}}$ highlights the
dependence of $P_{\rm merger}$ on $q$ and $e_{\rm out}$, two of the key factors
that determine the strength of the octupole effect (of course $P_{\rm merger}$
depends on other system parameters such as $m_12$, $a_0$, $a_{\rm out}$, etc.).
The bottom panels of Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist}
show our numerical results. In all of these plots, there is a retrograde
inclination window for which successful merger is guaranteed. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p3}, it can be seen that a large range of prograde
inclinations have a probabilistic outcome. In Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p2},
while the enhanced octupole strength allows for most of the prograde
inclinations to merge with certainty, there is still a region around $I_0
\approx 80^\circ$ where $P_{\rm merger} < 1$.

\subsection{Merger Probability: Analytic Criteria}\label{ss:nogw_merger}

By comparing the top and bottom panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist}, it is clear that
their features are correlated: in all five cases, the retrograde merger window
occupies the same inclination range as the retrograde octupole-active window,
while $P_{\rm merger}$ is only nonzero for prograde inclinations where
$e_{\max}$ nearly attains $e_{\lim}$. Here, we further develop this connection
and show that the non-dissipative simulations can be used to predict the
outcomes of simulations with GW dissipation rather reliably.

In Section~\ref{ss:windows}, we identified both one-shot and smooth mergers in
our simulations. Towards understanding the one-shot mergers, we first define
$e_{\rm os}$ to be the $e_{\max}$ required to dissipate an order-unity fraction
of the binary's orbital energy via GW emission in a single ZLK cycle. Since a
binary spends a fraction $\sim j(e_{\max})$ of each ZLK cycle near $e_{\max}$
\citep[e.g.,][]{anderson2016formation}, we set
\begin{equation}
    j\p{e_{\rm os}}\at{\rd{\ln a}{t}}_{e = e_{\rm os}} \sim
        -\frac{1}{t_{\rm ZLK}},
\end{equation}
where $\rdil{(\ln a)}{t}$ is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_tgw}. This yields
\begin{equation}
    j^6(e_{\rm os})
        \equiv \frac{842}{15}
            \frac{G^3 \mu m_{12}^3}{m_3c^5a^4n}
            \p{\frac{a_{\rm out, eff}}{a}}^3,
            \label{eq:def_e_os}
\end{equation}
where we have approximated $e_{\rm os} \approx 1$. Then, if a system satisfies
$e_{\max} > e_{\rm os}$ with $e_{\max}$ based on non-dissipative integration, it
is expected attain a sufficiently large eccentricity to undergo a one-shot
merger.

Towards understanding smooth mergers, we seek a characteristic eccentricity that
captures GW emission over many ZLK cycles. We define $e_{\rm eff}$ as an
effective ZLK maximum eccentricity, i.e.
\begin{align}
    \ev{\rd{\ln a}{t}} &= -\frac{1}{t_{\rm GW, 0}}
            \ev{\frac{1 + 73e^2/24 + 37e^4/96}
                {j^7(e)}}\nonumber\\
        &\equiv -\frac{421/96}{t_{\rm GW, 0}}\frac{1}{j^6(e_{\rm eff})},
        \label{eq:def_e_eff}
\end{align}
where $t_{\rm GW, 0} = \p{t_{\rm GW}}_{\rm e = 0}$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:def_tgw}),
and the angle brackets denote averaging over many ZLK cycles.
In the second line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_e_eff}, we have essentially replaced the ZLK-avergaed
orbital decay rate by $\rdil{(\ln a)}{t}$ evaluated at $e_{\rm eff}$ multiplied
by $j(e_{\rm eff})$.
In practice (see Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist}),
we typically average over $2000 t_{\rm ZLK}$ of
the non-dissipative simulations to compute $e_{\rm eff}$.

With $e_{\rm eff}$ computed using Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_e_eff}, we can define the
critical effective eccentricity $e_{\rm eff, c}$ such that the inspiral time is
a Hubble time:
\begin{equation}
    \ev{\rd{\ln a}{t}} \equiv \frac{421/96}{t_{\rm GW, 0}j^6(e_{\rm eff, c})}
        = \p{10\;\mathrm{Gyr}}^{-1}. \label{eq:def_e_eff_c}
\end{equation}
Thus, if a system is evolved using the non-dissipative equations of motion and
satisfies $e_{\rm eff} > e_{\rm eff, c}$, then it is expected to successfully
undergo a smooth merger within a Hubble time.

Therefore, a system can be predicted to merge successfully if it satisfies either
the one-shot or smooth merger criteria. The analytic merger probability (as a
function of $I_0$ and other parameters) is:
\begin{equation}
    P_{\rm merger}^{\rm an}\p{I_0; q, e_{\rm out}} =
        P\p{e_{\rm eff} > e_{\rm eff, c} \;\;\text{or}\;\;
        e_{\max} > e_{\rm os}}.\label{eq:def_pmerge_sa}
\end{equation}
Although not fully analytic (since numerical integrations of non-dissipative
systems are needed to obtain $e_{\rm eff}$ and $e_{\max}$ in general),
Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_pmerge_sa} provides efficient computation of the merger
probability without full numerical integrations including GW radiation.

The top panels of Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist}
show $e_{\rm eff}$ and $e_{\max}$, and their critical values, $e_{\rm eff, c}$
and $e_{\rm os}$. Using these, we compute the analytic merger probability, shown
as the thick green lines in the bottom panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist}. We generally
observe good agreement with the numerical $P_{\rm merger}$. However, $P_{\rm
merger}^{\rm an}$ slightly but systematically underpredicts $P_{\rm merger}$ for
some configurations, such as the prograde inclinations in
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_1p3} and~\ref{fig:composite_bindist}. These regions
coincide with the inclinations for which the merger outcome is uncertain. This
underprediction is due to the restricted integration time of $2000 t_{\rm ZLK}
\approx 3\;\mathrm{Gyr}$ used for the non-dissipative simulations. To illustrate
this, we also calculate $P_{\rm merger}^{\rm an}$ using a shorter integration
time of $500 t_{\rm ZLK}$ for our non-dissipative simulations. The results are
shown as the light green lines in the bottom panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_bindist}, performing visibly
worse. A more detailed discussion of this issue can be found in
Section~\ref{ss:completeness}.

A few observations about Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_pmerge_sa} can be made. First, it
explains why some prograde systems merge probabilistically ($0 < P_{\rm merger}
< 1$): for the prograde inclinations in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p3},
the $e_{\rm eff}$ values scatter widely around $e_{\rm eff,c}$ [or more
precisely, $j(e_{\rm eff})$ scatters around $j(e_{\rm eff,c})$], even for a
given $I_0$, so the detailed merger outcome depends on the initial conditions.
For the prograde inclinations in Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p2}, the double-valued
feature in the $e_{\max}$ plot (the top panel) pointed out in
Section~\ref{ss:oct_gen} represents a sub-population of systems that do not
satisfy Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_pmerge_sa}. Second, $e_{\max} > e_{\rm os}$ often
ensures $e_{\rm eff} > e_{\rm eff, c}$ in practice, as the averaging in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_e_eff} is heavily weighted towards extreme eccentricities. As
such, $e_{\rm eff} > e_{\rm eff, c}$ alone is often a sufficient condition in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_pmerge_sa}.

The one-shot merger criterion ($e_{\max} > e_{\rm os}$) can also be used to distinguish two different
types of system architectures: if $e_{\lim} \gtrsim e_{\rm os}$ for a particular
architecture, then all initial conditions leading to orbit flips (i.e.\ in an
octupole-active window) also execute one-shot mergers. For $e_{\lim} \approx
1$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_elim} reduces to
\begin{equation}
    j(e_{\lim}) \approx \frac{8\epsilon_{\rm GR}}{9}\p{1 +
        \frac{\eta^2}{12}}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
which lets us rewrite the constraint $e_{\lim} \gtrsim e_{\rm os}$ as
\begin{align}
    \p{\frac{a}{a_{\rm out, eff}}} \gtrsim{}&
        0.0186
        \p{\frac{a_{\rm out, eff}}{3600\;\mathrm{AU}}}^{-7/37}
        \p{\frac{m_{12}}{50M_{\odot}}}^{17/37}\nonumber\\
        &\times\p{\frac{30M_{\odot}}{m_3}}^{10/37}
        \p{\frac{q / (1 + q)^2}{1/4}}^{-2/37}.\label{eq:q_237}
\end{align}
For the system architecture considered in
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_e91p5}, this condition is
indeed satisfied, and we see indeed that wherever the top panel suggests orbit
flipping ($e_{\max} = e_{\lim}$), the bottom panel shows $f_{\rm merger} \approx
1$. When the condition (Eq.~\ref{eq:q_237}) is not satisfied, one-shot mergers are
not possible, and $P_{\rm merger}$ is generally only nonzero for a small range
about $I_{\rm 0, \lim}$.

\section{Merger Fraction as a Function of Mass Ratio}\label{s:merger_frac}

Having deveopled an analytic understanding of the binary merger window and
proability in the last section (particularly Section~\ref{ss:nogw_merger}), we
now study the fracton of BH binaies in triples that successfuly merge under
various conditions---we call this the merger fraction.

\subsection{Merger Fraction for Fixed Tertiary Eccentricity}

We first consider the simple case where $e_{\rm out}$ is fixed at a few
specific values and compute the merger fraction as a function of the mass ratio
$q$. We consider isotropic mutual orientations between the inner and outer
binaries, i.e.\ we let $\cos I_0$ be drawn uniformly from the range $[-1, 1]$
(recall that $\omega$, $\omega_{\rm out}$, and $\Omega$ are drawn uniformly from
the range $[0, 2\pi)$ % chktex 9
when computing the merger proability $P_{\rm merger}$ at a given $I_0$). The
merger fraction is then given by:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm merger}\p{q, e_{\rm out}} \equiv
        \frac{1}{2}\int\limits_{-1}^1\mathrm{d}\cos I_0\;
            P_{\rm merger}\p{I_0; q, e_{\rm out}} .\label{eq:def_fmerge}
\end{equation}
This is proportional to the integral of the black lines (weighted by $\sin I_0$)
in the bottom panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_e91p5}. We can also use
analytic criteria introduced in Section~\ref{ss:nogw_merger} to predict the
outcome and merger fraction. This is computed by using $P_{\rm merger}^{\rm an}$
as the integrand in Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_fmerge}, or by evaluating the integral of
the thick green lines (weighted by $\sin I_0$) in the bottom panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_e91p5}.
Figure~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs} shows the resulting $f_{\rm merger}$ and the
analytic estimates for all combinations of $q \in \z{0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7,
1.0}$ and $e_{\rm out} \in \z{0.6, 0.8, 0.9}$. It is clear that the numerical
$f_{\rm merger}$ and the analytic estimate agree well, and that the merger
fraction increases steeply for smaller $q$.

In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs}, we see that the merger
fractions for the three $e_{\rm out}$ values overlap for small $\epsilon_{\rm
oct}$. This implies that $f_{\rm merger}$ depends only on $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$
in this regime, and not on the values of $q$ and $e_{\rm out}$ independently.
From Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_dist} (which has $\epsilon_{\rm oct} = 0.007$), we
see that this suggests that the size of the retrograde merger window only
depends on $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$, much like what Eq.~\eqref{eq:I_oct_MLL} shows
for the test-particle limit. However, once $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ is increased
sufficiently, the three curves in the right panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs} cease to overlap. This can be attributed to
their different $\eta$ values: for sufficiently small $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$, no
prograde initial inclinations successfully merge (e.g.\
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}), and the merger fraction is solely determined by
the size of the retrograde octupole-active window. But once $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$
is sufficiently large, prograde mergers become possible, and the merger fraction
is also affected by the size of the octupole-inactive gap, which depends on
$\eta$. This again illustrates the importance of the octupole-inactive gap,
which we comment on in Appendix~\ref{app:gap}.

Figure~\ref{fig:sweepbin_simpleouter} depicts the merger fractions for systems
with $a_0 = 50\;\mathrm{AU}$ (the other parameters are the same as in
Fig.~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs}). According to Eq.~\eqref{eq:q_237}, these
systems no longer satisfy $e_{\lim} \gtrsim e_{\rm os}$, so the
merger fraction is expected to diminish strongly and vary much more weakly with
$q$, as one-shot mergers are no longer possible. This is indeed observed,
particularly for the $e_{\rm out} = 0.6$ curve in
Fig.~\ref{fig:sweepbin_simpleouter}.

    outer binaries (uniform in $\cos I_0$). The other system parametsrs are the

\subsection{Merger Fraction for a Distribution of Tertiary Eccentricities}

For a distribution of tertiary eccentricities, denoted $P\p{e_{\rm out}}$, the
merger fraction is given by
\begin{align}
    \eta_{\rm merger}(q) &= \int \mathrm{d}e_{\rm out}\;
            P\p{e_{\rm out}} f_{\rm merger}\p{q, e_{\rm out}},\\
        &= \int\limits\mathrm{d} e_{\rm out}\; \frac{P\p{e_{\rm out}}}{2}
            \int\limits_{-1}^1\mathrm{d} \cos I_0\; P_{\rm merger}\p{I_0; q,
            e_{\rm out}}.
        \label{eq:def_eta_merge}
\end{align}
We consider two possible $P(e_{\rm out})$ with $e_{\rm out} \in [0, 0.9]$: (i) a
uniform distribution, $P\p{e_{\rm out}} = \textrm{constant}$, and (ii) a thermal
distribution, $P\p{e_{\rm out}} \propto e_{\rm out}$.

The top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:popsynth} shows $\eta_{\rm merger}$ (black
dots) for the fiducial triple systems (with the same parameters as in
Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_e91p5}). For each $q$, the
integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_eta_merge} is computed using $1000$ realizations
of random $e_{\rm out}$, $\cos I_0$, $\omega$, $\omega_{\rm out}$, and
$\Omega$. Not surprisingly, we see $\eta_{\rm merger}$ increases with decreasing
$q$. \textcolor{red}{When $q$ is small, a thermal distribution of $e_{\rm out}$
tends to yield higher $\eta_{\rm merger}$ than does a uniform distribution.}
We also compute the merger fraction using the analytic merger probability of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_pmerge_sa} on a dense grid of initial conditions uniformly
sampled in $e_{\rm out}$ and $\cos I_0$; the result is shown as the blue dotted
line in Fig.~\ref{fig:popsynth}, which is in good agreement with the uniform-$e_{\rm out}$ simulation
result (black).

To characterize the properties of merging binaries, the middle and bottom panels
of Fig.~\ref{fig:popsynth} show the distributions of merger times and merger
eccentricities (at both the LISA and LIGO bands) for different mass ratios. To
obtain the LISA and LIGO band eccentricities (with GW frequency equal to
$0.1\;\mathrm{Hz}$ and $10\;\mathrm{Hz}$ respectively), the inner binaries are
evolved from when they reach $0.005 a_0$ (at which point we terminate the
integration of the triple system evolution) to physical merger using
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:def_tgw}--\ref{eq:dedt_gw}). While the LIGO band eccentricities
are all quite small ($\lesssim 10^{-3}$), the LISA band eccentricities (at $0.1
\;\mathrm{Hz}$) are significant, with median $\gtrsim 0.2$ for $q\lesssim 0.5$.
We note that these eccentricities are generally smaller than those found in the
population studies of \citet{LL19}. This is because in this paper we consider
only sufficiently hierachical systems for which double-avergaed evolution
equations are valid, whereas \citet{LL19} included a wider range of triple
hierachies and had to use $N$-body integrations to evolve some of the systems.

For comparison, Figure~\ref{fig:popsynth5500} shows the results when
$a_{\rm out, eff} = 5500\;\mathrm{AU}$ (instead of $a_{\rm out, eff} =
3600\;\mathrm{AU}$ for Fig.~\ref{fig:popsynth}) with all other parameters
unchanged. While $\eta_{\rm merger}$ is lower than it is for $a_{\rm out, eff} =
3600\;\mathrm{AU}$, there is still a large increase of $\eta_{\rm merger}$ with
decreasing $q$. Since Eq.~\eqref{eq:q_237} is still satisfied, this is expected.

\subsection{$q \ll 1$ Limit}

For fixed $m_{12}$ (and other parameters), even though the octupole strength
$\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ increases as $q$ decreases, the efficiency of GW
radiation also decreases. It is therefore natural to ask at what $q$ these
competing effects become comparable and the merger fraction is maximized. We
show that this does not happen until $q$ is extremely small.

We see from Figs.~\ref{fig:composite_dist}--\ref{fig:composite_e91p5} that
$e_{\lim} > e_{\rm os}$ for our fiducial triple systems. Indeed,
from Eq.~\eqref{eq:q_237}, we see that even for $q$ as small as $10^{-5}$, the
condition $e_{\lim} > e_{\rm os}$ is satisfied. This implies that most binaties
execute one-shot mergers when undergoing an orbit flip. In addition, recall that
the characteristic time for the binary to approach $e_{\lim}$ can be estimated
by Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_tzlkoct}, which, for our fiducial triple systems, is given
by
% 1.7e6 * 128 * sqrt(10) / 15 pi * sqrt(eps_oct)
\begin{equation}
    t_{\rm ZLK, oct} \simeq 10^8\s{\p{\frac{a / a_{\rm out}}{45}}
        \p{\frac{1 - q}{1 + q}}\p{\frac{e_{\rm out} / 1 - e_{\rm
        out}^2}{0.93}}}^{-1/2}\;\mathrm{yr}.
\end{equation}
Since $t_{\rm ZLK, oct } \ll 10\;\mathrm{Gyr}$, this implies that the
octupole-ZLK-induced binary merger fractions are primarily determined by what
initial conditions would lead to extreme eccentricity excitation and only weakly
depend on the GW radiation rate. Indeed, Eq.~\eqref{eq:q_237} shows that, while
$e_{\lim} > e_{\rm os}$ is indeed violated if $q$ is decreased sufficiently, the
dependence is extremely weak. Thus, $\eta_{\rm merger}$ is expected to be very
nearly constant for all physically relevant values of $q$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{a2eff_nogw_lowq3600.png}
    \caption{Same as blue dashed line of the top panel of
    Fig.~\ref{fig:popsynth} but extended to very small $q$. Due to the very weak
    $q$ dependence in Eq.~\eqref{eq:q_237}, $f_{\rm merger}$ is expected to
    depend very weakly on $q$ when $q \ll 1$ (such that $\epsilon_{\rm oct}$ is
    approximately constant), which agrees with the simulation
    results.}\label{fig:popsynth_lowq}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Limitations of Analytic Calculation}\label{ss:completeness}

It can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs} that the analytic
merger fractions are systematically lower than the values obtained from the
direct simulations. One reason that this discrepancy arises is because the
non-dissipative simulations used to compute $e_{\rm eff}$ and $e_{\max}$ are
only run for $2000 t_{\rm LK} \approx 3\;\mathrm{Gyr}$, while the full
simulations including GW dissipation are run for $10\;\mathrm{Gyr}$. Owing to
the chaotic nature of the octupole-order ZLK effect, this means that, if an
initial condition leads to extreme eccentricities only after many Gyrs, then
$e_{\rm eff}$ and $e_{\max}$ are underpredicted by the non-dissipative
simulations. Additionally, there are times when eccentricity vector of the inner
binary is librating, during which orbit flips are strongly suppressed
\citep{katz2011long}. Since the librating phase can last an unpredictable amount
of time, this suggests that the analytic merger criteria can become more
complete as the integration time is increased.

We quantify the ``completeness'' of the analytic merger fraction via the ratio
$f_{\rm merger}^{\rm an} / f_{\rm merger}$ as a function of non-dissipative
integration time. We focus on the fiducial triple systems for
demonstrative purposes and compute the completeness for each of the $q$ and
$e_{\rm out}$ combinations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs}.
Figure~\ref{fig:completeness} shows the completeness for each of these
simulations in light grey lines and their mean in the thick black line. We see
that the completeness is still increasing even as the non-dissipative simulation
time is increased to $2000t_{\rm ZLK}$, so we expect that even longer
integration times would give even better agreement with the dissipative
simulations.

    lines indicate the completeness for particular combinations of $(q, e_{\rm
    out})$, and the thick black line denotes their average. We see that
    completeness is still increasing as the integration time approaches $2000
    t_{\rm ZLK} \approx 3\;\mathrm{Gyr}$. }\label{fig:completeness}

\section{Mass Ratio Distribution of Merging BH Binaries}\label{s:q_dist}

In Section 4, we have calculated the binary BH merger fractions $f_{\rm merger}$
and $\eta_{\rm merger}$ as a function of the mass ratio $q$ for some
representative triple systems. To determine the distribution in $q$ and $m_{12}$
(total mass) of the merging binaries, we would need to know both the
distribution in $q$, $m_{12}$ and $a_0$ of the inner BH binaries and the
distribution in $m_{\rm out}$, $a_{\rm out}$ and $e_{\rm out}$ of the outer
binaries, denoted respectively:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\md g}{ \md q \md m_{12} \md a_0},\quad
    \frac{\md g_{\rm out}}{ \md m_{\rm out} \md a_{\rm out} \md e_{\rm out}}.
\end{equation}
The distribution in $q$ and $m_{12}$ of the merging binaries is then
\begin{align}
    & {\md g_{\rm merge}\over \md q \md m_{12}} = \int \!\md a_0 \md m_{\rm
        out}\md a_{\rm out}\md e_{\rm out}\, {\md g\over \md q \md m_{12} \md
        a_0}\nonumber\\
    &\qquad \times {\md g_{\rm out}\over \md m_{\rm out} \md a_{\rm out} \md  e_{\rm out}}\,
      f_{\rm merger}(q,e_{\rm out}; m_{12},a_0,m_{\rm out},a_{\rm out},e_{\rm out}),
      \label{eq:dong1}
\end{align}
where $f_{\rm merger}$ is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_fmerge} (assuming random
mutual inclinations between the inner and outer binaries), and we have spelled
out its dependence on various system parameters. Some examples of $f_{\rm
merger}$ are shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:total_merger_fracs}--\ref{fig:sweepbin_simpleouter}. If we
further specify the eccentricity distribution of the outer binaries, we have
\begin{align}
    & {\md g_{\rm merge}\over \md q \md m_{12}} = \int
        \!\md a_0 \md m_{\rm out}\md a_{\rm out}\,
        {\md g\over \md q \md m_{12} \md a_0}\nonumber\\
    &\qquad \times {\md g_{\rm out}\over \md m_{\rm out} \md a_{\rm out,eff}}\,
        \eta_{\rm merger}(q; m_{12},a_0,m_{\rm out},a_{\rm out,eff}),
        \label{eq:dong2}
\end{align}
where $\eta_{\rm merger}$ is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_eta_merge}. Some
examples of $\eta_{\rm merger}$ are shown in the top panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:popsynth}--\ref{fig:popsynth5500}.

Clearly, to properly evaluate Eq.~\eqref{eq:dong1} or~\eqref{eq:dong2} would
require large population synthesis calculations and in any case would involve
significant uncertainties, a task beyond the scope of this paper. For
illustrative purposes, we just consider the fiducial triple systems as studied
in Section~\ref{s:merger_frac}, and estimate the mass-ratio distribution of BH
mergers as
\begin{equation}
   {\md g_{\rm merge}\over \md q}\sim {\md g\over \md q}\, \eta_{\rm merger}(q).
    \label{eq:gmerge_dq}
\end{equation}

\subsection{``Initial'' $q$-distribution of BH Binaries}\label{ss:qdist_init}

The initial mass-ratio distribution of BH binaries, $\md g/\md q$, is uncertain.
It can be derived from the the mass distributions of of main-sequence (MS)
binaries, together with the MS mass ($m_{\rm ms}$) to BH mass ($m$) relation.

For the distribution of MS binary masses, we assume that each MS component mass
is drawn from a Salpeter-like initial mass function (IMF) independently, with
\begin{equation}
    {\md g_{\rm ms} \over \md m_{\rm ms} }\propto m_{\rm ms}^{-\alpha},
        \label{eq:def_alpha}
\end{equation}
in the range $m_{\min}\le m_{\rm ms} \leq m_{\max}$. Note in this case the MS
binary mass-ratio distribution is (for $q\leq 1$)
\begin{equation}
    {\md g_{\rm ms}\over \md q}\propto q^{\alpha -2}
        \left[ 1-\left( \frac{q}{q_{\min}}\right)^{2-2\alpha}\right],
\end{equation}
where \textcolor{red}{$q_{\min} = m_{\min}/m_{\max}$ is the minimum possible
binary mass ratio} \citep[this is a generalization of the result
of][]{tout_dist}. We consider two representative values of $\alpha$: (i) $\alpha
= 2.35$, the canonical Salpeter IMF \citep{salpeter1955luminosity}, and (ii)
$\alpha = 2$, resulting in a uniform $q$ distribution. The latter case is
consistent with observational studies of the mass ratio of high-mass MS binaries
\citep{sana2012binary, duchene2013, kobulnicky2014, moe2017mind}.

To then obtain $\rdil{g}{q}$ from this, we compute the BH binary mass ratio
when mapping each main sequence mass $m_{\rm ms}$ to its corresponding BH mass
$m$. This mapping is taken from \citet{spera2017very} for the mass range
$25M_{\odot} \leq m_{\rm ms} \leq 117 M_{\odot}$. We consider both the case
where $Z = 0.02$ (``high $Z$'') and where $Z = 2.0 \times 10^{-4}$ (``low
$Z$''), the two limiting metallicities used in \citet{spera2017very}.
We can then numerically compute $\rdil{g}{q}$ by sampling masses for stellar
binaries from the IMF, translating these into BH masses, then calculating the
resulting BH mass ratios for each binary. The uppermost panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:qdist_salpeter} shows the $\rdil{g}{q}$ obtained via this
procedure for a Salpeter IMF ($\alpha = 2.35$) when sampling $10^5$ MS binaries
for each metallicity. In the lower four panels, we also show $\rdil{g}{q}$
restricted to particular ranges of $m_{12}$. Note that the distributions differ
significantly among the $m_{12}$ ranges and also between the two metallicities.
Figure~\ref{fig:qdist_uniform} shows the case when $\alpha = 2$, which mostly
resembles Fig.~\ref{fig:qdist_salpeter}.

\subsection{$q$-distribution of Merging BH Binaries}\label{ss:qdist_merge}

We can also estimate the mass ratio distribution among merging BHs using
Eq.~\eqref{eq:gmerge_dq}. For $\eta_{\rm merger}$, we use a simple approximation
that lies roughly between the two cases shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:popsynth}--\ref{fig:popsynth5500}:
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{\rm merger}(q) \approx 0.2 \times \s{\max\p{q, 0.2}}^{-2}.
        \label{eq:etam_approx}
\end{equation}
Then, by Eq.~\eqref{eq:gmerge_dq}, we can also calculate $\rdil{g_{\rm
merge}}{q}$; these are displayed as the dotted curves in
Figs.~\ref{fig:qdist_salpeter}--\ref{fig:qdist_uniform} in each panel. Broadly
speaking, $\rdil{g_{\rm merge}}{q}$ decreases as $q$ increases in all of the
cases, and the dashed curves in the top panels of
Figs.~\ref{fig:qdist_salpeter}--\ref{fig:qdist_uniform} bear little resemblance
to the observed $q$ distribution among merging BH binaries shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:qhist}.

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{s:conclusion}

We have considered the dynamics of a comparable-mass tertiary-induced binary BH
merger by studying the ZLK effect at the octupole order. We show that for system
architectures where the merger fraction is substantial, most merging systems
have small mass ratios. For instance, for the fiducial system architecture ($a =
100\;\mathrm{AU}$, $a_{\rm out} = 3600\;\mathrm{AU}$, inner binary mass
$50M_{\odot}$ and tertiary mass $30M_{\odot}$), the merger fraction varies by a
factor of $\sim 20$ between $q = 0.2$ and $q = 1.0$ (see e.g.\ the top panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:popsynth}). On the other hand, where the merger fraction only
varies weakly with $q$, the absolute merger fractions must also be small (see
e.g.\ the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sweepbin_simpleouter} for $e_{\rm out} =
0.6$). We demonstrate that the difference between these two regimes is whether
octupole-induced one-shot mergers are possible and quantify this condition
analytically in Eq.~\eqref{eq:q_237}. Finally, we show that the mass ratio
distribution for tertiary-induced BH binaries is dependent on many uncertainties
but is broadly inconsistent with the observed distribution in the LIGO O3a data
release.

We discuss a few caveats of our work. It is possible that the distribution of
$a$ and $a_{\rm out}$ in tertiary-induced BH mergers is such that octupole-order
ZLK effect is generally weak, e.g.\ the $e_{\rm out} = 0.6$ curve in the top
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sweepbin_simpleouter}. However, in this regime, the
overall merger fractions are also significantly reduced, requiring the existence
of many more BH triples to match observed merger rates
\textcolor{red}{(CITATION?)}. It is also possible that the tertiary in most
triples is a significantly more massive body, such as a supermassive BH, in
which case $\epsilon_{\rm oct} \ll 1$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:eps_oct}). It is furthermore
possible that the BH binary mass ratio distribution at binary formation is much
more skewed towards equal masses than we predict in Section~\ref{ss:qdist_init}
(e.g.\ if stellar binaries with significantly asymmetric masses unbind as their
components become BHs). Lastly, recall that the double-averaged (DA) equations
of motion are used throughout this work. However, most of the qualitative
behavior we observe is expected to persist when using either single-averaged
equations or N-body simulations, e.g.\ \citet{LL19} find that $f_{\rm merger}$
is larger for the single-averaged and N-body regimes, but the qualitative trends
are unchanged.

In fact, for our fiducial systems, the DA approximation appears at first to be
marginally invalid: it reqires the orbital period $P_{\rm out}$ of the outer
binary be much shorter than the maximum rate of change of the angular momentum
of the inner binary, or
\begin{equation}
    t_{\rm ZLK}\;j\p{e_{\lim}} \lesssim P_{\rm out}.
\end{equation}
For our fiducial triple systems, this condition is only marginally satisfied in
the case where $e_{\rm out} = 0.9$ and $a_{\rm out, eff} = 3600\;\mathrm{AU}$.
However, when GW radiation is included, $e_{\lim}$ is unattainable if $e_{\rm
os} < e_{\lim}$. The condition $t_{\rm ZLK}\;j\p{e_{\rm os}} \lesssim P_{\rm
out}$ is satisfied by all systems we have considered, and thus the use of the DA
approximation does not affect the accuracy of our results.

\section{Origin of Octupole-Inactive Gap}\label{app:gap}

In this section, we investigate the origin of the ``octupole-inactive gap'', an
inclination range near $I_0 \approx 90^\circ$ for which $e_{\max}$ does not
attain $e_{\lim}$ despite being in between two octupole-active windows. This gap
was first identified in Section~\ref{ss:oct_gen}, and is seen in both the
non-dissipative and full simulations with GW dissipation.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{1p2dist.png}
    \caption{Octupole-active windows and amplitude of oscillation of $K$
    (Eq.~\ref{eq:def_K}). \emph{Top panel:} Maximum eccentricity $e_{\max}$
    attained by the inner binary with initial tertiary inclination $I_0$ when
    integrated for $2000 t_{\rm ZLK}$ (blue dots), reproduced from the top panel

    (Eq.~\ref{eq:def_elim}, horizontal red dashed line), the quadrupole-level
    result for $e_{\max}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:emax_quad}, dashed black line), the
    empirically-determined center of the gap, located at $I_0 \approx
    88.32^\circ$ (vertical black line), and the inclinations that can lead to
    extreme eccentricities (shaded purple regions). \emph{Bottom panel:} Minimum and maximum
    values of $K$, denoted $K_{\min}$ and $K_{\max}$, attained by the systems.
    Also shown are the initial $K$ for a given $I_0$ (black dashed line) and the
    critical $K_{\rm c} = -\eta / 2$ for orbit flipping (horizontal red dashed
    line). The center of the octupole-inactive gap and the octupole-active
    windows are labeled as in the top panel.
    }\label{fig:kdist}
\end{figure}

To better understand this gap, we first review the mechanism by which extreme
eccentricity excitation occurs. In the test-particle limit, \citet{katz2011long}
showed that $K$ oscillates over long timescales when $\omega$, the argument of
pericenter of the inner orbit, is circulating. This then leads to orbit flips
(and extreme eccentricity excitation) between prograde and retrograde
inclinations when $K$ changes signs: since $j(e)$ is nonnegative, the sign of
$K$ determines the sign of $\cos I$. \citet{katz2011long} obtain coupled
oscillation equations in $K$ and $\Omega_{\rm e}$, the azimuthal angle of the
inner eccentricity vector in the inertial reference frame. The amplitude of
oscillation of $K$ can then be analytically computed, and the octupole-active
window (the range of $I_0$ over which orbit flips occur) is the region for which
the range of these oscillations encompasses $K = 0$ \citep{katz2011long}.
Finally, when $\omega$ is librating instead, $\Omega_{\rm e}$ jumps by $\sim
180^\circ$ every ZLK cycle, and the oscillations in $K$ are suppressed.

In the finite-$\eta$ case, we commented in Section~\ref{ss:oct_gen} that the
relation between $K$ oscillations and extreme eccentricity excitation (and
orbit flipping) can be generalized even when $\eta$ is nonzero. $K$ still
oscillates over timescales $\gg t_{\rm ZLK}$ when $\omega$ is circulating, and
if its range of oscillation contains $K_{\rm c} \equiv -\eta / 2$, then the
inner orbit flips, in the process attaining extreme eccentricities. To be
precise, orbit flips are defined to be when the range of inclination
oscillations changes from $\p{\cos I_0}_- < \cos I < \cos I_{0, \lim}$ to $\cos
I_{0, \lim} < \cos I < \p{\cos I_0}_+$ or vice versa, where $\p{\cos I_0}_{\pm}$
are given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:I0bounds} and $I_{0, \lim}$ satisfies
Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_I0lim}.

However, the range of oscillation of $K$ is more complex than it is in the
test-particle limit. Figure~\ref{fig:kdist} compares the behavior of $e_{\max}$
in the non-dissipative simulations (top panel; reproduced from the top panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:composite_1p2}) to the range of oscillations in $K$ (bottom
panel). Denote the center of the gap $I_{\rm 0, gap}$ (shown as the vertical
black line in both panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:kdist}). Near $I_{\rm 0, gap}$, $K$
oscillates about $K(I_{\rm 0, gap})$, which is \emph{positive}, and the
oscillation amplitude goes to zero at $I_{\rm 0, gap}$. On the other hand, orbit
flips (and extreme eccentricity excitation) are possible when the range of
oscillation of $K$ encloses $K_{\rm c}$ (i.e.\ $K_{\min} < K_{\rm c} <
K_{\max}$). The purple shaded regions in both panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:kdist}
illustrate this equivalence, which contain the $e_{\lim}$-attaining inclinations
in the top panel and the inclinations where $K_{\min} < K_{\rm c} < K_{\max}$ in
the bottom panel. But since $K\p{I_{\rm 0, gap}} > 0$ while $K_{\rm c} < 0$,
there will always be a range of $I_0$ about $I_{\rm 0, gap}$ for which the
oscillation amplitude is smaller than $K\p{I_{\rm 0, gap}} - K_{\rm c}$, and
orbit flips are impossible in this range. This range is then precisely the
octupole-inactive gap.

This analysis has simply pushed our lack of understanding onto a new quantity:
why are $K$ oscillations suppressed in the neighborhood of $I_{\rm 0, gap}$? A
quantitative answer to this question is beyond the scope of this paper, but for
a qualitative understanding, we can examine the evolution of a system in the
octupole-inactive gap. The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nogw_circ} shows the same
simulation as Fig.~\ref{fig:nogw_fiducial} but with an additional panel showing
$\Omega_{\rm e}$, while the right panel shows a simulation with all the same
parameters except $I_0 = 88^\circ$, which is near $I_{\rm 0, gap}$ (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:kdist}). The oscillations in $K$ (third panels) are much smaller
for $I_0 = 88^\circ$ than for $I_0 = 93.5^\circ$, and no orbit flips occur. Most
interestingly, the fourth panel shows that the evolution of $\Omega_{\rm e}$ is
much less smooth than in Fig.~\ref{fig:nogw_fiducial}, jumping at almost every
other eccentricity maximum. \citet{katz2011long} have already pointed out that
jumps in $\Omega_{\rm e}$ occur when $\omega$ is \emph{librating}, rather than
circulating.

When the octupole-order terms are neglected, the circulation-libration
boundary is a boundary in $e$-$\omega$ space: as long as the ZLK separatrix
exists in the $e$-$\omega$ plane and $e_0 > 0$, then an initial $\omega_0 = 0$
causes $\omega$ to circulate, while an initial $\omega_0 = \pi/2$ causes
$\omega$ to librate \citep[e.g.,][]{kinoshita, shevchenko2016lidov}. However,
when including octupole-order terms, this picture breaks down. To illustrate
this, for a range of $I_0$ and both $\omega_0 = 0$ and $\omega_0 = \pi$, we
evolve the fiducial system parameters for a single ZLK cycle, using $q = 0.2$ as
is used for Figs.~\ref{fig:kdist} and~\ref{fig:nogw_circ}, and considered both
the dynamics with and without the octupole-order terms. Figure~\ref{fig:dW}
gives the resulting changes in $\Omega_{\rm e}$ over a single ZLK period when
the octupole-order effects are neglected (top) and when they are not (bottom).
Two observations can be made: (i) $I_{\rm 0, gap}$ is approximately where
$\Delta \Omega_{\rm e} = 0$ for circulating initial conditions when neglecting
octupole-order terms, and (ii) the inclusion of the octupole-order terms seem to
cause $\Omega_{\rm e}$ to exclusively vary slowly ($\abs{\Delta \Omega_{\rm e}}
\ll 180^\circ$) except for $I_{\rm 0, gap} < I_0 < I_{0, \lim}$. The former is
plausible: if $K(I_{\rm 0, gap})$ is the location of an equilibrium in
$K$-$\Omega_{\rm e}$ space, then it must satisfy $\Delta \Omega_{\rm e} = 0$.
The latter suggests that the assumption of circulation of $\omega$ in
\citet{katz2011long} may be satisfied for many more initial conditions than the
quadrupole-level analysis suggests, as long as they are not in octupole-inactive
gap.

Finally, examination of the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:kdist} suggests that
the oscillation amplitude in $K$ grows roughly linearly with $\abs{I_0 - I_{\rm
0, gap}}$ in the vicinity of $I_{\rm 0, gap}$ \citep[this may be because, in the
test-particle limit, librating $\omega$ give oscillation amplitudes in $K$ that
are higher-order in $K$ and $\Omega_{\rm e}$, as pointed out
by][]{katz2011long}. This lets us calculate the gap width very simply as
\begin{equation}
    \text{Gap Width} = 2\p{I_{0, \lim} - I_{\rm 0, gap}}.
\end{equation}
This explains why the gap does not exist in the test-particle regime, as $I_{0,
\lim} = I_{\rm 0, gap} = 90^\circ$ by symmetry of the equations of motion.

It is clear from the preceeding discussion and Fig.~\ref{fig:dW} that the
octupole-order, finite-$\eta$ dynamics are complex, and our preceeding
discussion can only be considered heuristic. Nevertheless, in the absence of a
closed form solution to the octupole-order ZLK equations of motion or a full
generalization of the work of \citet{katz2011long}, they provide a preliminary
understanding of the octupole-inactive gap.
