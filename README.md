## Eccentric tides things
- In comparison section (5.1 of notes), discovered a factor of 2 in the
  normalization of the Hansen coefficients, what did I doooooo. Probably
  real/imaginary part or something like that

- Questions:
    - What if near resonance & not traveling wave approx, can do anything?
    - What if non-power-law torque, can do anything?
    - What about solar type stars where nonlinear g modes in radiative core, can
      compete w/ convective-viscosity damping of p modes in convective envelope?

- Outline:
system is of great interest, lots of massive stars, many are eccentric
(precursor of DNS, SNe kick, e.g. SYSTEM), can they circularize efficiently?
Decays into high mass xray binary, of interested whether it circularizes

S2: sum of modes, formula, give closed form (plus constants-dropped term)

S3: application to SYSTEM

Appendix: show sum, + fit against stuff
