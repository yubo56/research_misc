## Eccentric tides things
- In weak tides + far from resonance (Vick & Lai 2019, solar type + RG), propto
  F(N2) x N, can integrate using derivative tricks + Parsevals theorem. Trick
  will handle integer power law torques
- Caveats: everything is traveling wave approx, no modes
- Questions:
    - What if near resonance, can do anything?
    - What if non-power-law torque, can do anything?
    - What about solar type stars where nonlinear g modes in radiative core, can
      compete w/ convective-viscosity damping of p modes in convective envelope?
