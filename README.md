## Eccentric tides things
- In comparison section (5.1 of notes), discovered a factor of 2 in the
  normalization of the Hansen coefficients, what did I doooooo. Probably
  real/imaginary part or something like that

- Questions:
    - What if near resonance & not traveling wave approx, can do anything?
    - What if non-power-law torque, can do anything?
    - What about solar type stars where nonlinear g modes in radiative core, can
      compete w/ convective-viscosity damping of p modes in convective envelope?
