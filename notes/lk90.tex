\section{Equations}

\subsection{Bin's Papers}

Our major references will be Bin's paper with Diego + Dong in 2015 (LML15) and
Bin's later paper with Dong on spin-orbit misalignment (LL18). The target of
study is \S4.3 of LL18, where a $90^\circ$ attractor in spin-orbit misalignment
seems to appear when the octupole effect is negligible.

The easiest formulation is just to express everything in terms of $\bm{L}$ and
$\bm{e}$, following LL18. We drop octupole terms and hold the third perturber
constant. These equations come out to be (Eqs.~4--5 w/ substitutions)
\begin{align}
    \rd{\bm{L}}{t} &= \frac{3}{4t_{LK}} \mu \sqrt{Gm_{12}a} \s*{
        \p*{\bm{j} \cdot \hat{n}_2} \p*{\bm{j} \times \hat{n}_2}
        - 5\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}\p*{\bm{e} \times \hat{n}_2}
        },\\
    \rd{\bm{e}}{t} &= \frac{3}{4t_{LK}} \s*{
        \p*{\bm{j} \cdot \hat{n}_2} \p*{\bm{e} \times \hat{n}_2}
        + 2\bm{j} \times \bm{e}
        - 5\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}\p*{\bm{j} \times \hat{n}_2}
        }.
\end{align}
Note that $\bm{j} \equiv \sqrt{1 - e^2}\hat{\bm{L}} = \frac{\bm{L}}{\mu
\sqrt{Gm_{12}a}}$. $m_{12} = m_1 + m_2$ and $\mu = m_1m_2/m_{12}$. We've defined
\begin{equation}
    t_{LK} \equiv \frac{L_1}{\mu_1 \Phi_0}
        = \frac{1}{n_1}\p*{\frac{m_{12}}{m_3}}
            \p*{\frac{a_2}{a}}^3
            \p*{1 - e_2^2}^{3/2}.
\end{equation}
Here, $n_1 \equiv \sqrt{Gm_{12}/a^3}$. Thus, $1 / t_{LK} \propto a^{3/2}$.

GW radiation (Peters 1964) cause decays of $\bm{L}$ and $\bm{e}$ as
\begin{align}
    \at{\rd{\bm{L}}{t}}_{GW} &= -\frac{32}{5}\frac{G^{7/2}}{c^5}
        \frac{\mu^2 m_{12}^{5/2}}{a^{7/2}}
        \frac{1 + 7e^2/8}{\p*{1 - e^2}^2}\hat{L},\\
    \at{\rd{\bm{e}}{t}}_{GW} &= -\frac{304}{15} \frac{G^3}{c^5}
        \frac{\mu m_{12}^2}{a^4\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}\p*{1 + \frac{121}{304}
            e^2}\bm{e}.
\end{align}
Here, $m_{12} \equiv m_1 + m_2$, and $a$ is implicitly defined by $\bm{L}$ and
$e$. The last GR effect is precession of $\vec{e}$, which acts as
\begin{align}
    \at{\rd{\bm{e}}{t}}_{GR} &= \frac{1}{t_{GR}}\hat{\bm{L}} \times \bm{e},\\
    \frac{1}{t_{GR}} &\equiv \frac{3Gnm_{12}}{c^2a\p*{1 - e^2}}.
\end{align}
Note that $t_{GR}^{-1} \propto a^{-5/2}$.

Given this system (from LML15 + LL18), we can then add the spin-orbit coupling
term (from de Sitter precession), which is given in LL18 to be
\begin{align}
    \rd{\hat{\bm{S}}}{t} &= \frac{1}{t_{SL}}\hat{\bm{L}} \times \hat{\bm{S}},\\
    \frac{1}{t_{SL}} &\equiv \frac{3Gn\p*{m_2 + \mu/3}}{2c^2a\p*{1 - e^2}}.
\end{align}
Note that $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the inner binary. We can drop the
back-reaction term since $S \ll L$. Thus, $t_{SL}^{-1} \propto a^{-5/2}$ as
well.

Finally, an adiabaticity parameter can be defined:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A} &\equiv \abs*{\frac{\Omega_{SL}}{\Omega_L}}.
\end{align}
Here, $\Omega_L \simeq\frac{3\p*{1 + 4e^2}}{8t_{LK}\sqrt{1 - e^2}}\abs*{\sin
2I}$ is an approximate rate of change of $L$ during an LK cycle

It's natural to redimensionalize to the initial LK time such that
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{t_{LK, 0}} \equiv \p*{\frac{a}{a_0}}^{3/2}\frac{1}{t_{LK}},
\end{equation}
since nothing else in $t_{LK}$ is changing. The next natural timescale for
gravitational waves is
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{t_{GW}} \equiv \frac{G^3 \mu m_{12}^2}{c^5a^4}
        \equiv \frac{1}{t_{GW, 0}} \p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^4
        \equiv \epsilon_{GW} \frac{1}{t_{LK, 0}} \p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^4.
\end{equation}
We can repeat the procedure for the GR precession term and the spin-orbit
coupling terms:
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{t_{GR}} &= \epsilon_{GR}\frac{1}{t_{LK, 0}}
        \p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2},\\
    \frac{1}{t_{SL}} &= \epsilon_{SL}\frac{1}{t_{LK, 0}}
        \p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}.
\end{align}
Thus, finally, if we let $\tau = t / t_{LK, 0}$, then we obtain full equations
of motion (note that $a_0 = 1$ below)
\begin{align}
    \rd{\bm{L}}{\tau} ={}& \p*{\frac{a}{a_0}}^{3/2} \frac{3}{4}\sqrt{a}\s*{
            \p*{\bm{j} \cdot \hat{n}_2} \p*{\bm{j} \times \hat{n}_2}
            - 5\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}\p*{\bm{e} \times \hat{n}_2}
            }\nonumber\\
        &- \epsilon_{GW}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^4
            \frac{32}{5} \frac{1 + 7e^2/8}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}\bm{L},\\
    \rd{\bm{e}}{\tau} ={}& \p*{\frac{a}{a_0}}^{3/2} \frac{3}{4}\s*{
            \p*{\bm{j} \cdot \hat{n}_2} \p*{\bm{e} \times \hat{n}_2}
            + 2\bm{j} \times \bm{e}
            - 5\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}\p*{\bm{j} \times \hat{n}_2}
            }\nonumber\\
        &-\epsilon_{GW}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^4
            \frac{304}{15} \frac{1}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}\p*{1 + \frac{121}{304}
                e^2}\bm{e}\nonumber\\
        &+ \epsilon_{GR}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}\frac{1}{1 - e^2}
            \hat{\bm{L}} \times \bm{e},\\
    \rd{\hat{\bm{S}}}{t} ={}&
        \epsilon_{SL}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}\frac{1}{1 - e^2}
        \hat{\bm{L}} \times \hat{\bm{S}}.
\end{align}
For reference, we note that $a = \abs*{\bm{L}}^2 / \p*{\mu^2 Gm_{12}\p*{1 -
e^2}}$, while $\bm{j} = \bm{L} / \p*{\mu\sqrt{Gm_{12}a}}$. To invert $a(\bm{L})$
and $\bm{J}\p*{\bm{L}}$ in this coordinate system where $a_0 = 1$, it is easiest
to choose the angular momentum dimensions such that $\mu \sqrt{Gm_{12}} = 1$,
such that now
\begin{align}
    \abs*{\bm{L}\p*{t = 0}} \equiv \mu \sqrt{Gm_{12}a_0\p*{1 - e_0^2}}
        &= \sqrt{\p*{1 - e_0^2}},\\
    a &= \frac{\abs*{\bm{L}}^2}{1 - e^2},\\
    \bm{j} &= \frac{\bm{L}}{\sqrt{a}} = \hat{\bm{L}}\sqrt{1 - e^2}.
\end{align}

Finally, the timescales are
\begin{align}
    t_{LK, 0} &= \frac{1}{n}
        \frac{m_{12}}{m_3}\p*{\frac{a_2}{a(t = 0)}}^3 \p*{1 - e_2^2}^{3/2},\\
    \epsilon_{GW} \equiv \frac{t_{LK, 0}}{t_{GW, 0}}
        &= \frac{1}{n}
            \frac{m_{12}}{m_3}\frac{a_2^3}{\p*{a(t = 0)}^7} \p*{1 - e_2^2}^{3/2}
            \frac{G^3 \mu m_{12}^2}{c^5},\\
    \epsilon_{GR} \equiv \frac{t_{LK, 0}}{t_{GR, 0}}
        &= \frac{m_{12}}{m_3}\frac{a_2^3}{\p*{a(t = 0)}^4} \p*{1 - e_2^2}^{3/2}
            \frac{3Gm_{12}}{c^2},\\
    \epsilon_{SL} \equiv \frac{t_{SL, 0}}{t_{GR, 0}}
        &= \frac{m_{12}}{m_3}\frac{a_2^3}{\p*{a(t = 0)}^4} \p*{1 - e_2^2}^{3/2}
            \frac{3G\p*{m_2 + \mu/3}}{2c^2}.
\end{align}

The adiabacitity parameter
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A} \equiv \abs*{\frac{\Omega_{SL}}{\Omega_L}}
        = \frac{\epsilon_{SL}}{t_{LK, 0}}
            \p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}\frac{1}{1 - e^2}
            \s*{\frac{3(1 + 4e^2)}{8t_{LK, 0}\sqrt{1 - e^2}}
                \p*{\frac{a}{a_0}}^{3/2}\abs*{\sin 2I}}^{-1},
\end{equation}
(note that $\Omega_L$ is a somewhat averaged sense, see LL18) can be evaluated
in these units as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A} = \epsilon_{SL}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^4\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}}
        \frac{8}{3\p*{1 + 4e^2}\abs*{\sin 2I}}.
\end{equation}

Note also that the Hamiltonian is just
\begin{equation}
    H = \Omega_{SL} \hat{\bm{L}} \cdot \hat{\bm{S}},
        = \epsilon_{SL}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2} \frac{1}{1 - e^2}
            \hat{\bm{L}} \cdot \hat{\bm{S}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Maximum Eccentricity and Merger Time}

Note that, since we are only evolving $\bm{L}$ and $\bm{e}$, and not $\bm{L}_2$
and $\bm{e}_2$, we are in the test mass approximation, under which we set $\eta
= 0$ in Bin's equations. As such, the maximum eccentricity satisfies (Eq 42 of
LL18 with $\eta \to 0$)
\begin{equation}
    \frac{3}{8}\frac{j_{\min}^2 - 1}{j_{\min}^2}\s*{
        5\cos I_0^2 - 3j_{\min}^2} + \epsilon_{GR}\p*{1 - \frac{1}{j_{\min}}} =
        0.
\end{equation}
Note that $\epsilon_{GR}$ is exactly as we defined above, incidentally, and that
when GR is negligible, this reduces to the classic $j_{\min} \equiv \sqrt{1 -
e_{\max}^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}\cos^2 I_0}$. Since $\epsilon_{GR}$ is generally
very small for most of the evolution, this generally reduces to the well known
\begin{equation}
    e_{\max} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{5}{3}\cos^2I_0}.
\end{equation}
This only fails to saturate for extremely high eccentricies, so $I_0 \to
90^\circ$.

\subsection{Attractor Behavior}

Proposal: The reason the $90^\circ$ attractor appears is that the initial
$\theta_{sb}$ is roughly stationary for $\mathcal{A} \ll 1$ (only small kicks
during each LK cycle, as long as the maximum eccentricity isn't too large), then
as we enter the transadiabatic regime, the L-K cycles die down and we simply
have conservation of adiabatic invariant.

The latter half of this follows the LL18 claim, where the requirement that
$\epsilon_{GR} \lesssim 9/4$ (GR precession of pericenter is slow enough that
L-K survives) equates to $\mathcal{A} \lesssim 3$. The former half of this is
somewhat tricky, but we can understand what is happening if we consider what is
happening in the frame corotating with $\Omega_{SL, e = 0}$ about $\hat{z}$:
every time that a LK cycle appears, $\Omega_{SL}$ becomes much larger, and the
axis of precession changes from $\hat{z}$ to the location of $\hat{L}$ very
briefly. We can imagine this as a kick in this corotating frame (which is the
right frame to consider for $\mathcal{A} \ll 1$). In the limit that $I$ does not
change very much between L-K cycles, and the azimuthal angle of $\hat{L}$ is
roughly symmetric, the impulses roughly cancel out in the $\theta_{sb}$
direction. In other words, after two LK cycles, $\theta_{sb}$ does not change
much in the corotating frame. This is indeed the picture that we obtain when we
observe the plot.

As such, the hypothesis is that if $\mathcal{A} \gtrsim 1$ is satisfied while
the kicks are still \emph{small}, then deviations about $90^\circ$ cannot be
very large, and adiabatic invariance tilts us right over. On the other hand, if
the kicks have become \emph{large}, then $\theta_{sb}$ after any particular LK
cycle is far from $90^\circ$, and this is frozen in during the adiabatic
invariance phase. This explains the key observation that the initial
$\theta_{sb}$ eventually becomes the final $\theta_{sl}$, regardless of whether
it is $90^\circ$. Furthermore, it explains why the kicks to $\theta_{eff}$
become larger over time, but peak smaller for larger $I_0$.

The natural way to think about this is to consider the evolution of the
trajectory in $(a, e)$ space. There are two curves that can be drawn on here,
$\mathcal{A} \sim 1$ and $\abs*{\Delta \theta_{sb}} \sim 1$ (the kick size), and
then we can see which one gets crossed first. The hypothesis is that the first
always gets crossed first, but if $e_{\max}$ is too large, then the second gets
crossed in the same LK cycle, and we get kicked far away from the starting
$\theta$, and have this frozen into $\theta_{sl}$. We need to find out how to
draw these boundaries in $(a, e)$ space. Drawing $\mathcal{A}$ is very easy,
since we have the explicit formulla for it.

To get the kick size, we have to integrate one of the LK peaks. This is easiest
done by considering the evolution of the $\delta e \equiv 1 - e$ variable by
dotting $\vec{e}$ into $\rd{\vec{e}}{t}$, such that
\begin{align}
    2e\rd{e}{t} &= \rd{\p*{\vec{e} \cdot \vec{e}}}{t}
        = 2\vec{e} \cdot \rd{\vec{e}}{t},\\
        &= -\frac{15}{2t_{LK}}\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}
            \p*{\hat{n}_2 \cdot \p*{\bm{e} \times \bm{j}}},\\
        &\lesssim \pm\frac{15}{2t_{LK}}e^2\sqrt{1 - e^2},\\
    \rd{e}{t} &\sim -\frac{15}{4t_{LK}}e\sqrt{1 - e^2},\\
    \rd{(\delta e)}{t} &\sim \frac{15}{4t_{LK}}\sqrt{2\delta e},\\
    \delta e(t) &\sim \p*{\frac{15 t}{4\sqrt{2}t_{LK}}}^2.
\end{align}
The finding of a power law/quadratic seems in accordance w/ my simulations,
though I have to plot $\delta e - \delta e_{\min}$. Then, we can simply
integrate
\begin{align}
    \Delta \theta_{sb} &\sim \oint\limits_{LK}
            \Omega_{SL}\;\mathrm{d}t,\\
        &\sim \frac{\epsilon_{SL}}{2}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}
            \oint\limits_{LK} \frac{1}{\delta e}\;\mathrm{d}t,\\
        &\sim \frac{\epsilon_{SL}}{2}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}
            \oint\limits_{LK}
            \frac{1}{\delta e_{\min} + \p*{\frac{15}{4\sqrt{2}t_{LK}}}^2
                t^2}\;\mathrm{d}t,\\
        &\sim \frac{\epsilon_{SL}}{2 \delta e_{\min}}\p*{\frac{a_0}{a}}^{5/2}
            \pi \frac{4t_{LK} \sqrt{2 \delta e_{\min}}}{15},\\
        &\sim \frac{\epsilon_{SL}}{\sqrt{2\delta e_{\min}}}\frac{a_0}{a}
            \pi \frac{4}{15}.
\end{align}
In the last few steps, we've just taken the bounds of integration to be $t \in
[-\infty, \infty]$ for simplicity (they contribute negligibly), and used $t_{LK}
= (a / a_0)^{3/2}$ since $t_{LK, 0} = 0$.

If we now explicitly write down the criteria where $\mathcal{A} \sim 1$ and
$\Delta \theta_{sb} \sim 1$ in the $(a, e)$ plane, then we obtain
\begin{align}
    a_{c,\theta} &\sim \frac{\epsilon_{SL}}{\sqrt{2\delta e_{\min}}}
        \frac{4\pi}{15},\\
    a_{c, \mathcal{A}} &\sim
        \s*{\epsilon_{SL}\frac{8/3}{\sqrt{1 - e_{\min}^2}
            \p*{1 + 4e_{\min}^2}\abs*{\sin 2I}}}^{1/4}.
\end{align}
The key difference between the two is that kicks occur at $e_{\max}$ or $\delta
e_{\min}$, while the adiabaticity parameter is moreso evaluated at $e_{\min}$.

\textbf{Update:} This cannot be the correct mechanism since it would generate
symmetric scatter of $\theta_{sl}$ about $\theta_{sb, 0}$, which is not the case
(see Fig 19 of LL18). Instead, it must really be how quickly the axis of
precession of $\rd{\hat{\bm{S}}}{t}$ moves compared to the precession
frequency, or indeed $\abs*{\Omega_{eff}}$ as compared to
$\rd{\hat{\bm{\Omega}}_{eff}}{t}$.

\subsection{More analysis on LL18's proposal}

Note that, since $\theta_{sb}$ during the LK oscillations will receive a
sequence of kicks, it randomizes the ordering a bit, so exact conservation of
$\theta_{sb, i}$ to $\theta_{sl, f}$ is not maintained (i.e.\ the ordering can
change somewhat).

But ultimately, it must boil down indeed to comparison of the change in
precession axis vs the precession frequency. One of the key difficulties in this
conclusion in LL18 is neglect of nutation in Equations~64 and~65. However, in
the transadiabatic regime, the LK cycles are of small amplitude ($1 - e$
typically at least $\lesssim 0.1$, often $\lesssim 0.01$ throughout the cycles)
and are fast, and as a result $I$ is to good approximation constant and nutation
can likely be neglected; at worst an average value of $\bm{L}$ can be used. The
final spread in $\theta_{sl, f}$ probably comes from the spread in $\theta_{sb,
i}$ upon exiting the nonadiabatic regime, due to the kicks during the LK cycles.
\textbf{NB:} Another way to argue that the fast nutation can be ignored is if
$\Delta I \ll \theta_{\rm eff, S}$, since then the spin vector just precesses
around a fuzzy vector, which isn't a huge deal. If the precession frequencies
are equal, it's possible to hit an SHO-like resonance, which should probably be
dealt with TODO\@.

Let's suppose this is the case for the time being, where $e$, $I$, and $a$ are
all approximately slowly varying going into the transadiabatic regime. Then
let's go to the co-rotating frame with $\bm{L}$ (fix this in the $\hat{x},
\hat{z}$ plane) and look at the evolution of the components of $\bm{\Omega}_{\rm
eff}$:
\begin{align}
    \bm{\Omega}_{\rm eff} &= \Omega_{SL}\p*{\sin I \hat{x} + \cos I \hat{z}}
            + \Omega_{pl} \hat{z},\\
    \hat{\bm{\Omega}}_{\rm eff} \cdot \hat{z}
        &= \frac{\Omega_{SL} \cos I + \Omega_{pl}}{
            \sqrt{\Omega_{SL}^2\sin^2 I + \p*{\Omega_{SL}\cos I
                + \Omega_{pl}}^2}}.
\end{align}
Then, we just have to compare $\rd{\arccos\hat{\Omega}_{\rm eff, z}}{t}$ to
$\Omega_{\rm eff}$ the magnitude, and this tells us whether $\hat{S}$ can track
$\bm{\Omega}_{\rm eff}$ as it moves. This tracks the polar angle, and the $z$
component doesn't have a singularity during the evolution and is preferable
(compared to the $x$ component). If all quantities are slowly varying (at
roughly constant speeds), the characteristic speed at which the polar angle
varies occurs when it is $\sim 90^\circ$, or when $\Omega_{\rm eff, z} \approx
0$, so we can simply the expression a bit
\begin{equation}
    \rd{\arccos\hat{\Omega}_{\rm eff, z}}{t}
        \lesssim \rd{}{t}\p*{\frac{\Omega_{SL} \cos I + \Omega_{pl}}{
            \Omega_{SL}\sin I}} \sim \frac{1}{\sin I}
                \rd{(\mathcal{A}^{-1})}{t}
\end{equation}

In summary, the picture is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Starting from some initial $\theta_{sb, 0}$, there are some random
        kicks (which cancel slightly better than a random walk, i.e.\ the
        variance does not seem to grow), we exit the nonadiabatic regime with
        some random value $\in \theta_{sb, 0} \pm \Delta \theta_{sb}$.

    \item Under the influences of $\epsilon_{GW}$ on $e_{\max}$ and
        $\epsilon_{GR}$ on $e_{\min}$, the trajectory flows towards a single
        point in $(a, e)$ space. Note that $I$ should be fixed by approximate
        conservation of the Kozai constant, since the GW effect is much weaker
        than the GR effect, and the GR effect preserves the Kozai constant.

    \item If the system hasn't exited the Kozai regime or merged at this point,
        it will evolve with small LK oscillations about GR decay of $e$ and $a$,
        coupled to convergence in $I$. As GR acts, this fuzz gets smaller and
        smaller amplitude until GR breaks the LK resonance.

        During this fuzzy phase, so long as $\Omega_{\rm eff} \gtrsim
        \rd{(\mathcal{A})^{-1}}{t}/\sin I$, then $\theta_{sb}$ gets sent to
        $\theta_{sl, f}$. The fuzz timescale is so short that it can be averaged
        over (the spin can't see it), so we should just have to consider the GR
        decay timescale when making this comparison.

    \item Regardless of whether the transadiabatic phase conserves the adiabatic
        invariant $\theta_{\rm eff}$, the final value is conserved once LK
        entirely disappears and it's just slow GR decay (which will evolve
        $\Omega_{\rm eff}$ slightly, but more obviously slowly).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timescales for My Picture}

\textbf{NB:} we are in the circulating regime of the L-K mechanism!

We now make some comments on the dynamics in each of these regimes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item During the initial pure-LK phase, there are small perturbations to
        $\theta_{sb}$ as we derived above.

        But furthermore, we can estimate the characteristic number of LK cycles
        by observing that the decay in the range of $\omega$ oscillation is what
        drives $e_{\min}$ to increase over time. We can integrate one Kozai
        cycle
        \begin{align}
            \Delta \omega &= \oint_{LK} \frac{3Gnm_{12}e}{c^2a\p*{1 - e^2}}
                \;\mathrm{d}t,\\
            &\approx \frac{Gnm_{12}e}{2c^2a}
                \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\delta e_{\min}
                    + \p*{\frac{15 t}{4\sqrt{2}t_{LK}}^2}}\;\mathrm{d}t,\\
            &\approx \frac{3Gnm_{12} 4\pi t_{LK}}{c^2a\sqrt{2\delta e_{\min}}}.
        \end{align}
        It's likely we can replace $\sqrt{2 \delta e_{\min}} \to \sqrt{1 -
        e_{\max}^2}$.

        We should be able to determine the number of Kozai cycles before
        coalescence by computing $\pd{H}{\omega}$ at $e_{\max}$, which I haven't
        done.

        If we ignore GW effects, the final state for this phase is where $e
        \approx e_{\max}, I \approx I_{\min}$. There are small corrections due
        to (i) GW decay near the high-e phases; we can estimate the former,
        since we also know the number of high-e cycles, but it may not be very
        important.

    \item During the fuzz phase, let's assert that $\omega, I$ make small
        amplitude oscillations about mean values that evolve slowly under GW
        emission (which also affects $a$): note that $I$ is affected because
        GW emission is approximately adiabatic compared to the LK timescale.
        What sets the frequency and amplitude of these oscillations?

        \textbf{Gave up:} some online references seem to suggest that
        oscillations get to order $\sim t_{LK} / 6$ as we have defined
        it\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05957.pdf}}, while in our
        simulations, each LK cycle actually is much longer than this initially,
        so that gives us a decent idea of the timescale of the ``fuzz.''
        \textbf{Edit:} It's probably even faster, since this is the librating
        timescale, so let's just assume the fuzz is very short scale.

        Looking at the phase portrait, it's more clear that the GR precession
        will eventually just send entire trajectory to be roughly constant at
        $e_{\max} \to 1$. This is truncated when $\rd{H}{t} = \pd{H}{e}\rd{e}{t}
        + \pd{H}{\omega}\rd{\omega}{t} = 0$, such that GR and GW cancel and the
        Hamiltonian does not change much over time. This probably sets the fuzz
        amplitude?

        I'm not very certain on this, I will need to do more numerical checks,
        because I'm not sure how the averaged trajectory through the fuzz
        evolves; what is being conserved? Maybe there's a higher phase space
        area than just $(x, e)$ where $x \equiv 1 - e^2$ (are they even
        canonical?). Also, bears noting that once $e_{\min}$ grows appreciably,
        $\dot{\omega}_{GR}$ is no longer spurty (acting only at $e_{\max}$), so
        it's likely that it no longer acts to increase either $e_{\min}$ or
        $e_{\max}$, it acts roughly symmetrically and just decreases the $e$
        fluctuation compared to the pure LK case.

        In any case, the fuzz decreases in amplitude over time and oscillates
        faster and faster, probably $\ll t_{LK}$ (indeed so, according to my
        plots).

    \item As we evolve through the fuzz, we want to understand whether
        $\theta_{\rm eff, S}$ evolves adiabatically. We need to evaluate the
        precession frequency and the rate of change of the precession axis, but
        for this we need expressions for $\dot{e}, \dot{I}, \dot{a}$ through the
        fuzz. Based on the final observation that $\dot{\omega}_{GR}$ doesn't
        affect the mean eccentricity, we can assert that $\dot{e} =
        \dot{e}_{GW}$, $\dot{a} = \dot{a}_{GW}$, while $I$ is constrained
        implicitly by conservation of the Kozai constant (so long as Kozai still
        is active).

        Using this, we can evaluate where this fuzz phase is adiabatic.

\section{$\bm{j}$ Equations}

We define vectors
\begin{align}
    \bm{j} &= \sqrt{1 - e^2}\hat{n},\\
    \bm{e} &= e\hat{u}.
\end{align}
Here, $\bm{j}$ is the dimensionless angular momentum vector and $\bm{e}$ is the
eccentricity vector; see LML15 for precise definitions. Note that $\bm{j} \cdot
\bm{e} = 0$, $j^2 + e^2 = 1$. Then, the EOM for the inner and outer vectors
satisfy to quadrupolar order
\begin{align}
    \rd{\bm{j}}{t} &= \frac{3}{4t_{LK}} \s*{
        \p*{\bm{j} \cdot \hat{n}_2} \p*{\bm{j} \times \hat{n}_2}
        - 5\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}\p*{\bm{e} \times \hat{n}_2}
        },\\
    \rd{\bm{e}}{t} &= \frac{3}{4t_{LK}} \s*{
        \p*{\bm{j} \cdot \hat{n}_2} \p*{\bm{e} \times \hat{n}_2}
        + 2\bm{j} \times \bm{e}
        - 5\p*{\bm{e} \cdot \hat{n}_2}\p*{\bm{j} \times \hat{n}_2}
        }.
\end{align}
Let's assume for the time being that $L_1 \ll L_2$, so the system is
sufficiently hierarchical that $\bm{j}_2$, $\bm{e}_2$ are constants. Note for
reference that
\begin{equation}
    t_{LK} \equiv \frac{L_1}{\mu_1 \Phi_0}
        = \frac{1}{n_1}\p*{\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_3}}
            \p*{\frac{a_2}{a}}^3
            \p*{1 - e_2^2}^{3/2}.
\end{equation}
Here, $n_1 \equiv \sqrt{G\p*{m_1 + m_2}/a^3}$. Thus, $1 / t_{LK} \propto
a^{3/2}$.

GW radiation (Peters 1964) cause decays of $\bm{L}$ and $\bm{e}$ as
\begin{align}
    \at{\rd{\bm{L}}{t}}_{GW} &= -\frac{32}{5}\frac{G^{7/2}}{c^5}
        \frac{\mu^2 m_{12}^{5/2}}{a^{7/2}}
        \frac{1 + 7e^2/8}{\p*{1 - e^2}^2}\hat{L},\\
    \at{\rd{\bm{e}}{t}}_{GW} &= -\frac{304}{15} \frac{G^3}{c^5}
        \frac{\mu m_{12}^2}{a^4\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}\p*{1 + \frac{121}{304}
            e^2}\bm{e},\\
    \at{\frac{\dot{a}}{a}}_{GW} &= -\frac{64}{5} \frac{G^3 \mu m_{12}^2}{c^5a^4}
        \frac{1}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{7/2}}\p*{1 + \frac{73}{24}e^2
            + \frac{37}{96}e^4}.
\end{align}
Here, $m_{12} \equiv m_1 + m_2$. The last GR effect is precession of $\vec{e}$,
which acts as
\begin{equation}
    \at{\rd{\bm{e}}{t}}_{GR} = \frac{3Gnm_{12}}{c^2a\p*{1 - e^2}}.
\end{equation}

Given this system (from LML15 + LL18), we can then add the spin-orbit coupling
term (from de Sitter precession), which is given in LL18 to be
\begin{align}
    \rd{\hat{S}}{t} &= \Omega_{SL}\hat{L} \times \hat{S},\\
    \Omega_{SL} &\equiv \frac{3Gn\p*{m_2 + \mu/3}}{2c^2a\p*{1 - e^2}}.
\end{align}
Note that $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the inner binary. We can drop the
back-reaction term since $S \ll L$. Thus, $\Omega_{SL} \propto a^{-5/2}$.

What is observed is that, as this system is evolved forward in time and GR
coalesces the inner binary, $\theta_{sl} \equiv \arccos\p*{\hat{S} \cdot
\hat{L}}$ goes to $90^\circ$ consistently. The relevant figure is Fig.~19 of
LL18, which shows that for a close-in, low-eccentricity perturber ($\bar{a}_{\rm
out, eff} \propto a_{out}$), the focusing is significantly stronger. Note that
initially, $I \equiv \arccos\p*{\hat{L} \cdot \hat{L}_2} \approx 90^\circ$ while
$\theta_{sl} \approx 0$.

Next, when accounting for GR, we should let $a$ evolve as above. Note that since
$\bm{j}$ and $\vec{e}$ are our dynamical variables, we should use $\bm{j} \equiv
\sqrt{1 - e^2} \hat{L} = \sqrt{1 - e^2}\frac{\bm{L}}{\mu \sqrt{Gm_{12}a\p*{1 -
e^2}}}$ and rewrite
\begin{equation}
    \at{\rd{\bm{j}}{t}}_{GW} = \frac{1}{\mu\sqrt{GMa}}\at{\rd{\bm{L}}{t}}_{GW}
        - \frac{\bm{j}}{2a}\at{\rd{a}{t}}_{GW}.
\end{equation}
To double check, we should verify that $\at{\rd{(j^2 + e^2)}{t}}_{GW} = 0$,
which can be verified as (Let's set $G = M = \mu = a = c = 1$ for convenience)
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}\rd{(j^2 + e^2)}{t}
        &= \bm{j} \cdot \rd{\bm{j}}{t} + \bm{e} \cdot \rd{\bm{e}}{t},\\
        &= \bm{j} \cdot \s*{
            \p*{-\frac{32}{5}\frac{1 + 7e^2/8}{\p*{1 - e^2}^2}}\hat{L}
                - \frac{\bm{j}}{2}\p*{-\frac{64}{5}
                    \frac{1 + 73e^2/24 + 37e^4/96}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{7/2}}}}
            + \bm{e} \cdot
                \p*{-\frac{304}{15}\frac{1 + 121e^2/304}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}}
                \bm{e},\\
        &= \p*{-\frac{32}{5}\frac{1 + 7e^2/8}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{3/2}}}
                + \p*{\frac{32}{5}
                    \frac{1 + 73e^2/24 + 37e^4/96}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}}
            + e^2 \p*{-\frac{304}{15}\frac{1 + 121e^2/304}{\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}}
                ,\\
        &= \frac{1}{15\p*{1 - e^2}^{5/2}}\s*{
            -96\p*{1 - e^2}\p*{1 + \frac{7e^2}{8}}
                + 96\p*{1 + \frac{73e^2}{24} + \frac{37e^4}{96}}
                - 304e^2\p*{1 + \frac{121e^2}{304}}}.
\end{align}
This can be verified to vanish upon term-by-term examination indeed.
